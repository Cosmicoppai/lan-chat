00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:07.625
(This film is based on true events.)

3
00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.168
(Spring 1980, Seoul)

4
00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:44.208
That girl who once gave
me a bouquet of flowers…

5
00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:53.793
Why do I miss her so much today?

6
00:01:56.918 --> 00:02:03.333
Her neatly bobbed hair,
like a rain-soaked blade of grass…

7
00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:12.458
Her sparkling eyes still shine in my heart.

8
00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:23.918
At times when I feel lonely,
I remember that day…

9
00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:33.000
At times when I miss her, I begin to dream…

10
00:02:35.793 --> 00:02:41.958
That longing I can't forget…

11
00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:51.500
How cruel that time has taken her away.

12
00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:09.293
(A TAXI DRIVER)

13
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:10.750
Private Taxi

14
00:03:10.793 --> 00:03:12.958
- Lift the state of emergency!
- Lift it! Lift it!

15
00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.750
No more martial law!

16
00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.833
No more! No more!

17
00:03:21.293 --> 00:03:22.625
What, is it an accident?

18
00:03:22.958 --> 00:03:26.000
Disperse, or we will act with force!

19
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.833
I repeat.

20
00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:30.043
Disperse,

21
00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:31.708
or we will act with force!

22
00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:38.458
I wondered why today was so quiet.

23
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.000
Did they go to university to protest?

24
00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.500
Enough is enough…

25
00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:09.875
Spoiled bastards need
to be shipped off to Saudi Arabia.

26
00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:13.125
Work themselves to death
in the burning desert,

27
00:04:13.168 --> 00:04:17.083
then they'll realize, "Wow,
my country is great!"

28
00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:30.833
How can you dash at my car?

29
00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:32.668
If you jump out like that…

30
00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:34.583
Run!

31
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:35.833
Hey, where are you going?

32
00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.168
Hey, you!

33
00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:38.583
Get back here!

34
00:04:38.625 --> 00:04:39.918
- Stop!
- Taxi!

35
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.625
Taxi!

36
00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:45.208
That…

37
00:04:46.543 --> 00:04:48.125
To the hospital, quickly!

38
00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:55.958
Mister, please go faster.

39
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.958
The first baby takes a long time,
even after the water breaks.

40
00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:02.458
My wife spent 12 hours
in the delivery room.

41
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.083
The first baby's always like that.

42
00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:08.043
Hey, hey, hey…

43
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.375
No more martial law!

44
00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:16.293
Don't tell me you're that close!

45
00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:19.043
Oh, whatever.

46
00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:26.293
(Throw out the dictatorship
and bring in democracy!)

47
00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.458
We're here, honey.

48
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:39.333
My best driving ever!

49
00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:40.875
This way.

50
00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.250
Other taxi drivers won't
take pregnant women.

51
00:05:44.293 --> 00:05:46.458
But I did, remembering my daughter's birth.

52
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.708
Thanks… Honey, where's my wallet?

53
00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:51.958
You packed the damn bag!

54
00:05:52.418 --> 00:05:54.293
Take another look, it must be there.

55
00:05:55.333 --> 00:05:59.043
Sorry but I left my wallet behind.
Tomorrow, I promise…

56
00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:00.918
You know how many times I heard that?

57
00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:03.500
I could've bought a house
with all that taxi fare!

58
00:06:03.543 --> 00:06:04.750
No, I promise…

59
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:06.583
There she goes again!

60
00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.000
It's coming!

61
00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:09.375
Hold on just a second!

62
00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:12.083
Here's my business card.

63
00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:14.543
Call me tomorrow, I'll pay double!
So sorry!

64
00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:18.333
Pay me double instead?

65
00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:21.293
Best of luck in there, okay?

66
00:06:21.793 --> 00:06:22.875
Best of luck!

67
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:03.500
This is no place to play soccer.
Go play over there!

68
00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:28.043
Did she go out?

69
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.875
Hey princess, sleeping already?

70
00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:40.708
You should eat dinner.

71
00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:44.708
Huh?

72
00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:51.208
Who did this to you?

73
00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:52.918
I fell down.

74
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.125
Sang-gu, that brat!

75
00:07:56.168 --> 00:07:59.083
It wasn't Sang-gu! I really fell.

76
00:07:59.543 --> 00:08:01.293
Are you gonna lie to your dad?

77
00:08:02.208 --> 00:08:04.208
Eun-jung! Should I hit you instead?

78
00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.458
Ma'am! Sang-gu!!

79
00:08:13.958 --> 00:08:16.750
Ah, just the person I wanted to see.

80
00:08:17.918 --> 00:08:20.418
What do you say about this?

81
00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.250
How could she do this to our precious son?

82
00:08:24.293 --> 00:08:26.083
But she also has…

83
00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.543
Really, I've never seen
a girl as wild as Eun-jung!

84
00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:32.625
You're too soft on her
'cause her mother died!

85
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.500
That's a bit…

86
00:08:35.543 --> 00:08:37.543
And since you're here, one more thing!

87
00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:40.543
I've held my tongue because
I know your situation.

88
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.333
But you owe me 100,000 won in rent!

89
00:08:44.875 --> 00:08:47.418
I'm sorry. Ma'am, I'll…

90
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:51.000
You're 4 months late,
at least tell us when you'll pay!

91
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.208
100,000 won is a lot of money for us too.

92
00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:58.625
Sang-gu, you're sleepy!
Must have eaten too much.

93
00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:04.418
I don't care what my husband says,
I've had it this time.

94
00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:11.750
And discipline your daughter, will you?

95
00:09:11.793 --> 00:09:14.333
Breaks my heart to see my son like this.

96
00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:32.958
Oh, I'm hungry!

97
00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:35.083
Bean sprout soup?

98
00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:40.375
Hey, don't fold the backs of your shoes.

99
00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:42.918
Not answering again.

100
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:47.168
Those shoes are too small. Dinner's ready.

101
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.708
Then ask me to buy you new ones!

102
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:03.043
Wow, tastes great.

103
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.293
You could get married tomorrow!

104
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.000
Sang-gu's mom brought that over.

105
00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.750
Right, I thought it was too salty.

106
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Lift your head.

107
00:10:37.293 --> 00:10:39.375
Dad, do we have to move?

108
00:10:39.418 --> 00:10:42.583
Yup, we're gonna buy Sang-gu's house.
After I get rich.

109
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.875
So don't worry and study hard.

110
00:10:45.375 --> 00:10:46.375
Okay?

111
00:10:55.418 --> 00:10:56.583
Ouch, it stings.

112
00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:59.250
Then why don't you listen?

113
00:10:59.668 --> 00:11:03.375
What did I say? Play nice
with him, don't fight.

114
00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:05.750
But he started it!

115
00:11:05.918 --> 00:11:07.168
Just ignore him.

116
00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:12.250
Learn to bear it. Life is
never going to be fair.

117
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.458
Want to go on a picnic this Wednesday?

118
00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:22.168
No school on Buddha's Birthday.

119
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.875
You should work. More
customers on holidays.

120
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.333
Oh my, you're even worse than your mother.

121
00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:36.375
Who do you take after, to be so sweet!

122
00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:45.833
Under the emergency decree
starting on May 18,

123
00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:49.918
martial law is in force,
all political activity is banned,

124
00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:53.000
the nation's universities
are temporarily closed,

125
00:11:53.333 --> 00:11:56.125
and labor strikes are strictly forbidden.

126
00:11:56.958 --> 00:11:59.958
The recent street
demonstrations by students…

127
00:12:00.583 --> 00:12:03.958
So does this mean I'll
lose passengers again?

128
00:12:17.418 --> 00:12:20.458
(May 19, 1980 Press Center, Tokyo)

129
00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.125
Beer and sushi again?

130
00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:42.458
Hey Peter, how was the parliament today?

131
00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:47.625
Same as always, nothing different.

132
00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.833
This is Jürgen Hinzpeter
from ARD-nDR, Germany.

133
00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:54.293
He's been living in Japan
for about 8 years.

134
00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:56.000
It might be helpful to know him.

135
00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:59.333
It's good to meet you,
Mr. Hinzpeter. David John, BBC.

136
00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:01.918
Just call me Peter.

137
00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:05.250
It's my first time in Japan.
Anything I should look out for?

138
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.168
It's comfortable.

139
00:13:10.043 --> 00:13:11.668
That's tricky… as a journalist,

140
00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.958
you shouldn't be in a place
that's too comfortable.

141
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Excuse me?

142
00:13:15.708 --> 00:13:18.750
Nothing. Where were you based before?

143
00:13:19.333 --> 00:13:22.293
South Korea. It's very
tense over there now.

144
00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:26.083
I heard their government
declared martial law.

145
00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:27.418
It's always tense there.

146
00:13:28.168 --> 00:13:29.833
I think it's much worse this time.

147
00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.708
On top of the martial law,
several opposition leaders were arrested,

148
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:34.918
and the universities got locked down too.

149
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:36.333
What else have you heard?

150
00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:38.601
I've been trying to contact
some people I know,

151
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.875
but it's… it's almost
impossible to get through.

152
00:13:42.168 --> 00:13:43.168
Since when?

153
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.668
Since last night.

154
00:13:57.293 --> 00:13:59.583
(Seoul, Korea)

155
00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:09.500
I work for the Church.

156
00:14:10.793 --> 00:14:11.793
I'm a missionary.

157
00:14:44.168 --> 00:14:45.293
It's been a long time.

158
00:14:47.918 --> 00:14:51.543
I need to get back soon.
Something doesn't feel right.

159
00:14:51.583 --> 00:14:53.083
How bad is the situation?

160
00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:55.958
It's been 3 days since the martial law.

161
00:14:56.458 --> 00:14:58.125
Kim Dae-jung has been taken in,

162
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.000
and they've got Kim Young-sam
under house arrest.

163
00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:14.500
Gwang-ju?

164
00:15:14.543 --> 00:15:16.168
It's a city down south.

165
00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:23.168
And there's no article about Gwang-ju?
No coverage, nothing?

166
00:15:30.958 --> 00:15:33.208
This is the local paper from Gwang-ju.

167
00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.375
They censored the whole page?

168
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.000
What exactly happened over there?

169
00:15:41.043 --> 00:15:42.168
No one knows.

170
00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:45.875
We got word of the first casualty
at 3 AM on the 19th…

171
00:15:45.918 --> 00:15:47.250
But now,

172
00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:49.875
even the phone lines have been cut.

173
00:15:50.543 --> 00:15:52.125
What about the foreign press?

174
00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:56.043
Today is Kim Jae-kyu's trial.
They all went there.

175
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.750
But the government has eyes on them.

176
00:15:58.793 --> 00:16:00.958
They can't move as they wish.

177
00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:03.875
You must be careful.

178
00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:10.293
I should go to Gwang-ju, first…

179
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.125
By yourself?

180
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.418
But how will you get there?

181
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.375
For a guy so paranoid about his car,

182
00:16:25.793 --> 00:16:27.583
how'd you break a mirror?

183
00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:31.543
A worthless punk. He ran
off after busting my car.

184
00:16:31.583 --> 00:16:33.793
Why be a student if you can't be
a decent human being?

185
00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:35.958
All right. I'll only
charge 5,000 won, okay?

186
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
What? Just take 4,000.
I've had a rough day.

187
00:16:39.043 --> 00:16:42.708
Have a heart, man! How can you be so cheap?

188
00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:46.958
And get an inspection sometime.
The engine doesn't sound right.

189
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.458
An inspection? I inspect my car every day.

190
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.250
After 600,000 km, this
car is past retirement.

191
00:16:52.293 --> 00:16:53.875
Easy on my car!

192
00:16:53.918 --> 00:16:56.375
Try fixing it after it
breaks, it'll cost you more.

193
00:16:56.418 --> 00:16:59.500
Don't give me bad luck! I'm already pissed.

194
00:16:59.543 --> 00:17:00.543
3,000 won, then.

195
00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:03.418
That is so unfair! You
know how much parts cost?

196
00:17:04.208 --> 00:17:07.000
- Throw this out?
- No way. I'll use it later.

197
00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:08.875
Leave it.

198
00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:11.668
Dammit!

199
00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.000
Hey, what're you doing?

200
00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:30.750
God, you're pathetic.

201
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:32.875
Pathetic?

202
00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:37.668
So, the kids fought again?

203
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:40.875
I gave Sang-gu a good scolding.

204
00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:43.583
Ma'am! Over here!

205
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.375
- What?
- Another portion for us.

206
00:17:45.418 --> 00:17:47.583
No, I'm fine. Never mind!

207
00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:49.208
Why not? I said I'd pay.

208
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.043
Don't be silly, I'll pay.

209
00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:52.293
What's the occasion?

210
00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:54.208
Instead, lend me some money.

211
00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:57.083
I figured. How much?

212
00:17:57.125 --> 00:18:00.208
100,000 won. From you private stash.

213
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.168
Hey! I gave it all to my sister
As a secret wedding gift.

214
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.418
But why so much? You
paid off all your debts.

215
00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:12.793
It's not the rent, is it?

216
00:18:13.168 --> 00:18:14.168
Bingo!

217
00:18:15.043 --> 00:18:16.043
My god.

218
00:18:16.668 --> 00:18:20.168
Only you would borrow
from your landlord to pay the rent.

219
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:25.050
Lend it to me before you
start saying things.

220
00:18:27.083 --> 00:18:29.668
Ma'am! Give me anything quick!

221
00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.583
What's the rush?

222
00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:33.625
We need to play cards after lunch.

223
00:18:34.043 --> 00:18:37.918
You guys play all you like.
I'm going to Kukdo Theater.

224
00:18:37.958 --> 00:18:39.793
- Got a long distance.
- Where to?

225
00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:43.375
Gwang-ju. We'll go now, and
be back before curfew.

226
00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:46.833
Wow, you hit the jackpot. For how much?

227
00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:48.625
100,000 won.

228
00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:49.833
100,000 won?

229
00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:52.918
What kind of idiot would
pay 100,000 for one day?

230
00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:54.418
A foreigner idiot.

231
00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:55.918
Oh, do you speak English?

232
00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:59.708
Of course. I grew up near the U.S.
army base.

233
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.668
Damn, and foreigners pay tips!
If you add the tip…

234
00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:06.958
You spent time abroad.
Couldn't you handle that?

235
00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:26.793
I'm sorry! Enjoy your lunch.

236
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:34.583
Ma'am, discipline Sang-gu, will you?
Who does he take after?

237
00:19:34.958 --> 00:19:37.293
And he eats too much. Takes after his mom?

238
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.668
Wait till I get that money!
I'll teach that kid some manners!

239
00:20:01.293 --> 00:20:02.543
Called for a taxi?

240
00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:08.875
Yes, but isn't this a private taxi?
I called a taxi company.

241
00:20:08.918 --> 00:20:14.375
Ah yes, but the company's
cars are all busy.

242
00:20:14.418 --> 00:20:16.000
So I volunteered…

243
00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:17.750
Does he understand what's going on?

244
00:20:17.793 --> 00:20:19.833
Of course. I explained everything.

245
00:20:20.918 --> 00:20:22.293
You were told everything?

246
00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:26.583
Yes, to Gwang-ju and back
before curfew for 100,000 won.

247
00:20:26.918 --> 00:20:28.293
And you speak English?

248
00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:30.500
Of course, of course!

249
00:20:30.708 --> 00:20:34.125
Sure, I spent 5 years in Saudi Arabia,
so I speak English.

250
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.000
Don't worry, don't worry! I'm Mr. Kim!

251
00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:41.418
Together, let's go Gwang-ju.

252
00:20:41.458 --> 00:20:43.918
Okay, nice to meet you!

253
00:20:44.708 --> 00:20:45.958
Please get in.

254
00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:47.083
Ok, okay.

255
00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:53.793
Thank you.

256
00:20:54.043 --> 00:20:55.043
Be careful.

257
00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:13.168
Take another taxi. This one's reserved.

258
00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:15.418
Reserved? For where?

259
00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:16.458
Why?

260
00:21:16.918 --> 00:21:18.418
This car's going to Gwang-ju.

261
00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:30.500
You Korea first time?

262
00:21:33.168 --> 00:21:34.583
No. it's my second time.

263
00:21:34.625 --> 00:21:35.708
Oh really?

264
00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:42.250
You are where from?

265
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:44.250
Germany.

266
00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.043
Germany, oh really?

267
00:21:47.918 --> 00:21:49.750
My friend…

268
00:21:49.793 --> 00:21:51.750
What's the word for that?

269
00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:53.958
He went to mine coal.

270
00:21:55.418 --> 00:21:58.000
I know, there are many
Korean workers in Germany.

271
00:21:58.043 --> 00:22:00.250
Nurses, miners.

272
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.793
I was in Saudi, you know?

273
00:22:02.168 --> 00:22:05.750
Do you know Saudi? This taxi, Saudi money.

274
00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:07.750
I drive Saudi truck.

275
00:22:07.793 --> 00:22:11.250
Driving in that desert, shit!

276
00:22:11.293 --> 00:22:13.418
People here don't have a damned clue!

277
00:22:14.168 --> 00:22:17.000
Listen, how far is it to Gwang-ju?

278
00:22:17.043 --> 00:22:19.003
I don't have much time, I
need to go there quick.

279
00:22:19.668 --> 00:22:21.168
Why is he talking so fast?

280
00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:25.668
You, fast. Huh? Slow…

281
00:22:26.333 --> 00:22:28.625
So that I can English.

282
00:22:29.083 --> 00:22:30.458
Slow, okay?

283
00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.958
Okay. Gwang-ju, we go fast. Okay? Fast!

284
00:22:35.168 --> 00:22:36.708
What's the hurry?

285
00:22:37.043 --> 00:22:38.500
Gwang-ju, don't worry! Don't worry!

286
00:22:38.543 --> 00:22:39.833
I'm best driver.

287
00:22:40.168 --> 00:22:42.668
It's really far. Get some sleep.

288
00:22:42.958 --> 00:22:45.000
Sleep… sleep.

289
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.833
You darling, you!

290
00:22:47.875 --> 00:22:50.293
My recent luck's been
shit all for this day.

291
00:23:54.293 --> 00:23:56.583
Hey hey, Gwang-ju! Gwang-ju!

292
00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:58.125
Gwang-ju? Are we here?

293
00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:14.958
What's this? Can we go?

294
00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:19.083
Don't slow down, keep going!

295
00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:22.043
Uh, yes yes.

296
00:24:22.083 --> 00:24:23.208
What's he shooting?

297
00:24:23.875 --> 00:24:25.668
What picture, what camera?

298
00:24:25.708 --> 00:24:26.708
Let's go, hurry!

299
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.125
Why so rude? If I ask
you something, answer.

300
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.333
And what's with this road?
Can I pass, or not?

301
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.043
What's this?

302
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.583
I'm not a reporter, you understand?

303
00:25:02.793 --> 00:25:04.583
Huh? What?

304
00:25:05.083 --> 00:25:06.458
I said to speak slow!

305
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.375
Are they training?

306
00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:18.375
Stop!

307
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.125
Is this a training exercise?

308
00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:23.583
What division?

309
00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:26.125
I did my service in the 7th division.

310
00:25:26.168 --> 00:25:28.168
This is a real operation. Turn back.

311
00:25:30.418 --> 00:25:31.793
Didn't you see the sign?

312
00:25:34.043 --> 00:25:35.793
My passenger's going to Gwang-ju.

313
00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:37.500
You idiot, are you trying to die?

314
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.668
Who the hell are you?

315
00:25:42.793 --> 00:25:43.918
What is he saying?

316
00:25:45.083 --> 00:25:46.293
Is he asking me something?

317
00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.583
What did he just say?

318
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.458
He said, let's go back. He made a mistake.

319
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:54.250
Allegiance!

320
00:26:07.875 --> 00:26:12.333
Excuse me, Driver. This
direction, also Gwang-ju?

321
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.708
No no Gwang-ju. Now, we go Seoul.

322
00:26:20.125 --> 00:26:21.125
Seoul?

323
00:26:21.918 --> 00:26:24.708
What are you talking about?
I have to go to Gwang-ju.

324
00:26:25.293 --> 00:26:27.668
That's what you think, and
it's not that I refuse.

325
00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:30.043
Soldier say, Gwang-ju no!

326
00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:35.168
Okay, you won't get paid
if you don't take me to Gwang-ju.

327
00:26:36.043 --> 00:26:37.043
You understand?

328
00:26:37.793 --> 00:26:39.543
What's he saying?

329
00:26:40.043 --> 00:26:42.208
No Gwang-ju, no money.

330
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.250
No money?

331
00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.543
Are you joking? You know
how much gas we used?

332
00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:51.083
Soldier say no Gwang-ju!

333
00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:52.708
We can't go there!

334
00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:53.958
No Gwang-ju!

335
00:26:55.083 --> 00:26:57.958
You what camera picture?

336
00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.458
Why you Gwang-ju?

337
00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500
Oh my god.

338
00:27:00.875 --> 00:27:02.793
You know what, just take me to Gwang-ju.

339
00:27:02.833 --> 00:27:04.726
That's all you should worry
about what I'm doing there.

340
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.125
It's none of your business, okay?

341
00:27:08.708 --> 00:27:09.708
Business?

342
00:27:12.125 --> 00:27:13.333
You businessman?

343
00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:14.625
So you go to Gwang-ju?

344
00:27:17.168 --> 00:27:18.958
Yes, Gwang-ju.

345
00:27:19.793 --> 00:27:21.418
No Gwang-ju no money.

346
00:27:22.708 --> 00:27:25.625
Shit, am I just going to waste gas money?

347
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:40.793
Sir!

348
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.543
Let me ask you something.

349
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:48.583
Is there any back road
to Gwang-ju around here?

350
00:27:49.043 --> 00:27:50.083
Nope.

351
00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.250
Then, is there anyone who'd know…

352
00:27:55.293 --> 00:27:57.293
What do you want there?

353
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.375
Didn't you see the soldiers?

354
00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:03.875
You'd be better off heading back home.

355
00:28:05.293 --> 00:28:07.793
Sir, if I can't get to Gwang-ju…

356
00:28:09.333 --> 00:28:12.793
Sir, I really need to go there!

357
00:28:13.293 --> 00:28:19.458
Our village foreman told us
to stay clear of Gwang-ju.

358
00:28:25.668 --> 00:28:30.668
Over that there hill,
there is one back road…

359
00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.043
Where is it?

360
00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:34.043
Over there…

361
00:28:34.708 --> 00:28:36.293
Over that side…

362
00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:47.793
This road's gonna ruin my shocks.

363
00:28:49.708 --> 00:28:52.083
You're lucky to have me, you know?

364
00:28:52.125 --> 00:28:55.125
Any other driver would
be back in Seoul by now.

365
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:59.293
Here, no soldier!

366
00:29:02.043 --> 00:29:03.958
Yeah, great. No soldier.

367
00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:15.543
What's going on, for them
to block even this road?

368
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.875
Stop! Who the hell…

369
00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:21.293
Turn back.

370
00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.875
I'm just trying to earn some money…

371
00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:27.375
You said you're a businessman?

372
00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:29.043
Dollars, contract.

373
00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:30.125
Contract…

374
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.750
Something like this.

375
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.458
Very very important paper!

376
00:29:35.668 --> 00:29:38.750
You forgot this, okay? In Gwang-ju.

377
00:29:39.708 --> 00:29:40.708
What?

378
00:29:42.418 --> 00:29:44.250
Good day, sir! Allegiance!

379
00:29:44.293 --> 00:29:45.083
Yes.

380
00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:47.125
I'm coming from Gimpo Airport.

381
00:29:47.458 --> 00:29:49.833
That guy is a really important businessman.

382
00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:54.000
He had to miss his plane to U.S.,
and return for important papers.

383
00:29:54.043 --> 00:29:55.668
No. Turn back!

384
00:29:55.708 --> 00:29:56.833
Please listen.

385
00:29:56.875 --> 00:30:00.583
Without those papers, we
can't export to the U.S.

386
00:30:00.625 --> 00:30:03.875
I came speeding here from the airport
all out of patriotism!

387
00:30:03.918 --> 00:30:06.958
We need to export so we can like,
get dollars! Yeah?

388
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.851
- What's wrong?
- To become a developed country…

389
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:09.918
Hold on a sec.

390
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Listen!

391
00:30:12.168 --> 00:30:15.833
If I don't get to Gwang-ju there
will be problems, big problems!

392
00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:17.918
My boss is a very important man.

393
00:30:17.958 --> 00:30:21.208
He'll be very unhappy if I don't
get back with those documents.

394
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.000
Very very unhappy! Tell him.

395
00:30:25.208 --> 00:30:26.500
What did he say?

396
00:30:28.043 --> 00:30:29.418
You said a hugely important…?

397
00:30:29.458 --> 00:30:30.833
Tell him, not me.

398
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.875
Very very important paper, okay?

399
00:30:33.043 --> 00:30:34.250
Very important paper.

400
00:30:34.293 --> 00:30:37.958
Important man, important paper.
Big, big trouble!

401
00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:51.043
Hey, clear a path.

402
00:30:52.543 --> 00:30:53.833
But come right back.

403
00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:55.918
It's dangerous there
because of the rioters.

404
00:30:56.543 --> 00:30:58.083
- Rioters?
- Yes.

405
00:30:59.458 --> 00:31:02.000
Yes, we'll be back in a flash.

406
00:31:02.043 --> 00:31:03.250
- Allegiance!
- Yes.

407
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.918
Nice job back there!

408
00:31:25.418 --> 00:31:26.543
My fare.

409
00:31:27.418 --> 00:31:29.375
100,000 won now.

410
00:31:31.168 --> 00:31:33.875
I've told you,
I'll pay you once we get back to Seoul.

411
00:31:33.918 --> 00:31:35.250
Gwang-ju dangerous.

412
00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:36.333
So pay in advance.

413
00:31:36.458 --> 00:31:37.458
First money.

414
00:31:38.918 --> 00:31:40.500
No, it's "Ladies first," so…

415
00:31:40.918 --> 00:31:41.918
Money first.

416
00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:43.918
Korea business style.

417
00:31:44.543 --> 00:31:46.293
Now no money, I go Seoul.

418
00:31:46.833 --> 00:31:47.833
Your choice.

419
00:31:49.543 --> 00:31:52.208
Go ahead and glare at me, you jerk.

420
00:31:52.625 --> 00:31:54.000
Your choice!

421
00:32:07.043 --> 00:32:08.333
You'll get the rest in Seoul.

422
00:32:09.043 --> 00:32:10.043
Your choice!

423
00:32:12.293 --> 00:32:15.043
What a fox. Are you copying me?

424
00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:18.833
Still, 50,000 is nice.

425
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.500
I choice! Let's go Gwang-ju, okay?

426
00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:23.668
Alrighty!

427
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.000
What a miser.

428
00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.918
Glare at me like that and
I'll rip your eyes out.

429
00:32:32.125 --> 00:32:33.833
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

430
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.375
Let's go Gwang-ju

431
00:32:37.418 --> 00:32:38.793
That's all I said.

432
00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:44.168
(To the citizens of democratic Gwang-ju…)

433
00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.625
(Defend Democracy to the Death!)

434
00:32:59.125 --> 00:33:00.875
What's going on here?

435
00:33:00.918 --> 00:33:03.125
(Rescind martial law!)

436
00:33:04.168 --> 00:33:07.168
Stop the car, Driver. What does that mean?

437
00:33:07.208 --> 00:33:08.418
Huh? What?

438
00:33:08.793 --> 00:33:11.458
(To the 1980s, Decade of Hope!)

439
00:33:11.625 --> 00:33:13.125
It says…

440
00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:16.083
Hope, hope. Eight.

441
00:33:16.125 --> 00:33:19.043
Ah, 80, 80. Hope.

442
00:33:19.083 --> 00:33:20.208
Hope?

443
00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.458
In the 1980s…

444
00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:25.168
Oh, it's just some crap. Forget about it.

445
00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:30.418
What's that?

446
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.583
Wait, stop! Pull over.

447
00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.083
Hey look, it's a Seoul taxi.

448
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.793
Whoa, it's a foreigner.

449
00:33:42.625 --> 00:33:44.293
Hi. Where are you going?

450
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.601
- What's he saying?
- Well…

451
00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:46.875
Isn't that a camera?

452
00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:51.833
Those university students
speak worse English than me.

453
00:33:53.208 --> 00:33:55.543
Hey, Jae-sik! You speak
some English, right?

454
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.958
Get over here, Jae-sik.

455
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.168
Why me?

456
00:34:02.958 --> 00:34:03.958
Hi.

457
00:34:04.418 --> 00:34:05.293
Hi.

458
00:34:05.333 --> 00:34:06.418
Where are you going?

459
00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:10.583
Where are you from?

460
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:14.418
Germany. German broadcast, ARD.

461
00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:20.043
German. Um.. Are you a reporter?

462
00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.543
Yes. I am a reporter.

463
00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:27.793
He's a reporter from
Germany, come to shoot us.

464
00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:34.793
We'll be on the news. Great!

465
00:34:35.293 --> 00:34:37.293
Businessman, my ass.

466
00:34:37.543 --> 00:34:38.976
If you're a reporter,
you should've told me!

467
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.875
He rode here in a taxi from Seoul!

468
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.083
Let's give a hand to the
taxi driver who came so far!

469
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:48.958
Ah well, from Seoul to here…

470
00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.250
Where are you headed now?

471
00:34:50.293 --> 00:34:51.293
…is pretty far.

472
00:34:52.833 --> 00:34:55.208
We go to the hospital for the sick.

473
00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:57.875
Can I come with you?

474
00:34:58.875 --> 00:34:59.543
Yes.

475
00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:00.750
I'd like to interview him.

476
00:35:03.708 --> 00:35:05.000
He wants to interview you.

477
00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:07.293
Wow, you're a star now!

478
00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:10.543
Ah, I should've at least washed my face.

479
00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:20.083
You come up too, Mister.

480
00:35:21.083 --> 00:35:22.208
What do you mean?

481
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.918
He needs to drive his taxi.

482
00:35:24.543 --> 00:35:25.833
Don't worry, don't worry.

483
00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.583
I'll be right behind you.

484
00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:30.583
Me too go!

485
00:35:31.293 --> 00:35:32.543
Then follow us!

486
00:35:34.083 --> 00:35:35.375
Let's go!

487
00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:47.250
We fight for justice, hoorah hoorah!

488
00:35:47.293 --> 00:35:50.043
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

489
00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:53.125
We'd rather die standing
than live on our knees!

490
00:35:53.168 --> 00:35:55.625
We fight for justice!

491
00:35:55.668 --> 00:35:59.168
I should've known 100,000 won
was too good to be true.

492
00:35:59.918 --> 00:36:02.875
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

493
00:36:03.293 --> 00:36:06.750
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

494
00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:09.833
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

495
00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:24.458
Can't risk my car getting damaged
in the protest again.

496
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:30.000
Oh my, taxi!

497
00:36:30.043 --> 00:36:32.833
Give me a lift, mister!

498
00:36:32.875 --> 00:36:36.083
Take a Gwang-ju taxi, granny.
This is a Seoul taxi.

499
00:36:39.583 --> 00:36:40.918
Oh jeez.

500
00:36:49.293 --> 00:36:51.668
Granny, can you even pay the fare?

501
00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.750
Who's in the hospital?

502
00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:59.958
They said someone who looks
like my youngest son

503
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.793
was brought there after
a soldier smashed his head.

504
00:37:05.293 --> 00:37:08.293
Is he a university student?
Does he protest?

505
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:11.418
He didn't even go to high school.

506
00:37:12.293 --> 00:37:15.793
Didn't come home last night.

507
00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:20.750
Then he must have been out
drinking with his friends!

508
00:37:21.168 --> 00:37:23.418
He can't drink.

509
00:37:23.958 --> 00:37:29.418
And those soldiers, they've gone berserk,

510
00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:35.418
beating and stabbing anyone who passes by.

511
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.958
Granny, I was an army sergeant.
No soldier would ever do that.

512
00:37:41.668 --> 00:37:44.043
Those are all just rumors, right?

513
00:37:44.083 --> 00:37:45.208
Of course…

514
00:37:46.458 --> 00:37:51.918
Then where the heck did he go?

515
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.293
No, I won't take you!

516
00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:14.750
Go see if they need help.

517
00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:17.793
Please drive. I have to rush.

518
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:19.293
What's your hurry?

519
00:38:19.875 --> 00:38:22.543
You don't write a single
line in the newspaper!

520
00:38:22.875 --> 00:38:25.875
You reporters have more
time than anyone now!

521
00:38:26.168 --> 00:38:29.625
If reporters don't report,
why should we drive?

522
00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:33.668
Gwang-ju taxi drivers must be rich,
turning down fares like that.

523
00:38:36.668 --> 00:38:37.500
Ma'am.

524
00:38:37.543 --> 00:38:39.875
Please give me a ride.

525
00:38:39.918 --> 00:38:40.958
No way.

526
00:38:41.168 --> 00:38:42.168
Damn it!

527
00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:44.375
Taxi, taxi!

528
00:38:44.418 --> 00:38:47.168
No, this is a Seoul taxi.
Take a Gwang-ju taxi.

529
00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:54.625
Go to the other side!

530
00:38:54.668 --> 00:38:55.668
Oh my.

531
00:38:56.458 --> 00:38:57.833
What a mess.

532
00:38:57.875 --> 00:38:59.000
A high school student?

533
00:38:59.043 --> 00:39:00.293
Careful!

534
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.793
Go call a doctor!

535
00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:05.125
Doctor!

536
00:39:05.293 --> 00:39:06.458
Doctor!

537
00:39:06.918 --> 00:39:12.293
Please find my youngest son.
I beg you, please…

538
00:39:14.125 --> 00:39:16.125
Where are you, Yong-pyo?

539
00:39:31.625 --> 00:39:35.043
Oh, Yong-pyo! My son…

540
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:40.168
Are you okay?

541
00:39:40.208 --> 00:39:41.208
Mom?

542
00:39:42.418 --> 00:39:43.750
Mom!

543
00:39:43.793 --> 00:39:44.918
Yong-pyo!

544
00:39:44.958 --> 00:39:46.458
What are you doin' here?

545
00:39:46.833 --> 00:39:49.168
Oh, you wicked boy!

546
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.875
I thought something awful happened to you.

547
00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:56.750
Are you okay?

548
00:39:56.793 --> 00:40:00.208
This ain't nothin' at all.
Just three stitches.

549
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:02.293
Are you hurt anywhere else?

550
00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.500
I'm totally fine.

551
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:10.833
- Sir, thank you so much!
- Oh…

552
00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:12.333
Thank you, really.

553
00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:13.625
Mom, wear this.

554
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Don't know what I'd have done
without this taxi driver.

555
00:40:18.043 --> 00:40:19.125
Thank you so much.

556
00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:22.043
You got some money?

557
00:40:22.668 --> 00:40:23.918
I ain't got money.

558
00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:26.625
Never mind, you don't need to pay me.

559
00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:28.958
See, I told you he'd be fine!

560
00:40:29.083 --> 00:40:31.958
Wait! Are you that Seoul taxi…

561
00:40:33.293 --> 00:40:34.500
You know me?

562
00:40:34.543 --> 00:40:35.543
It's you!

563
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.500
Yong-pyo, you know him?

564
00:40:39.543 --> 00:40:41.293
- A while back, this guy…
- Hey mister!

565
00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:45.668
What's he doing here?

566
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:48.068
Do you have any idea how much time
I wasted looking for you?

567
00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:50.375
We've been driving all
over trying to find you!

568
00:40:50.418 --> 00:40:51.668
Where is my film bag?

569
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:55.375
Who is he to yell at my driver!

570
00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.125
He ran off with this reporter's
expensive equipment.

571
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.750
What are you talking about?

572
00:41:02.208 --> 00:41:03.458
How dare you!

573
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.333
I took what? I didn't take anything!

574
00:41:07.833 --> 00:41:08.708
What's going on?

575
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.750
His…

576
00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:11.418
Look here!

577
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.583
What's this doing here?

578
00:41:20.043 --> 00:41:21.043
I don't know.

579
00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:22.543
I really didn't know.

580
00:41:23.168 --> 00:41:25.333
You said to follow, and then you sped off.

581
00:41:25.958 --> 00:41:29.918
I don't know the roads here.
You know how hard I searched?

582
00:41:29.958 --> 00:41:32.125
Hey mister, that ain't so.

583
00:41:32.958 --> 00:41:34.958
People saw you take a U-turn.

584
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.793
Hey, Yong-pyo! Watch it.

585
00:41:37.375 --> 00:41:40.543
Would he really take off
without collecting his fare?

586
00:41:40.668 --> 00:41:43.958
Here, the other half of the fare.

587
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.500
So you just go back to Seoul.
I'm better off on my own.

588
00:41:46.793 --> 00:41:50.208
What? He charged 50,000
won just to come here?

589
00:41:51.418 --> 00:41:55.125
Actually, they agreed on 100,000,
and he already received half.

590
00:41:55.168 --> 00:41:56.458
100,000 won?

591
00:41:57.668 --> 00:41:59.793
What? So he got paid and tried to run off?

592
00:42:01.918 --> 00:42:03.043
Take this and go!

593
00:42:04.083 --> 00:42:05.083
Just take it.

594
00:42:06.668 --> 00:42:08.625
Why are you giving this guy money?

595
00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:11.293
He's giving us all a bad name.

596
00:42:11.833 --> 00:42:16.043
Taxi drivers like this need
to be taught a lesson!

597
00:42:16.458 --> 00:42:19.333
Whose side are you guys on, anyway?

598
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:21.208
How dare you start shouting!

599
00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:24.333
Bro, am I wrong?

600
00:42:25.168 --> 00:42:26.833
Why don't you say something?

601
00:42:26.875 --> 00:42:28.125
What would I say?

602
00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:32.625
If he received his fare…

603
00:42:33.208 --> 00:42:35.833
would he really just ditch his passenger?

604
00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.543
Man, you're so wishy-washy.

605
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.500
I'm not wishy-washy.

606
00:42:42.083 --> 00:42:44.833
I'm firm when I need to be.
Don't you know me?

607
00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:48.418
Hey, Seoul Driver! You'll
pay for doing that.

608
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:52.708
As a driver it's wrong,
and as a human being it's wrong!

609
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.875
How dare you talk to me that way!

610
00:42:58.543 --> 00:43:01.543
I guess everything they
said about you was true!

611
00:43:01.958 --> 00:43:04.125
Let me take a look at your license number.

612
00:43:04.168 --> 00:43:06.333
What the hell are you doing?

613
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.500
Here!

614
00:43:11.583 --> 00:43:14.250
I'm not receiving anything, alright?

615
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.500
Let's go.

616
00:43:37.918 --> 00:43:40.793
College boy! Are you gonna
ride around in my car all day?

617
00:43:42.918 --> 00:43:45.000
He asked me to translate…

618
00:43:46.083 --> 00:43:48.168
Do your parents know what you're doing?

619
00:43:48.333 --> 00:43:50.333
Why are you chewing me out?

620
00:43:50.458 --> 00:43:52.625
Didn't you see back there?

621
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.333
Your mother must be worried sick.

622
00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:01.083
Paying that expensive tuition,
did you go to university to protest?

623
00:44:01.125 --> 00:44:04.333
You went to study, right?
Then you should study, dammit!

624
00:44:05.793 --> 00:44:07.668
I didn't go to university to study.

625
00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.210
I went to compete in the
university song contest.

626
00:44:18.208 --> 00:44:22.625
Then why not spend this time
practicing your singing?

627
00:44:23.208 --> 00:44:26.375
Mister, you don't know
what you're talking about.

628
00:44:26.418 --> 00:44:30.543
You students think other
countries are as nice as ours?

629
00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:32.458
Go to Saudi Arabia! In that hot, burning…

630
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.625
What's so great about a country
where soldiers assault you?

631
00:44:35.668 --> 00:44:37.833
Then why do you keep protesting?

632
00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:41.543
They keep telling you to stop,
but you won't listen!

633
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.668
How is it that this foreigner
understands better than you?

634
00:44:45.708 --> 00:44:46.750
Forget it.

635
00:44:46.793 --> 00:44:48.375
Seven o'clock go Seoul, okay?

636
00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:52.333
Okay.

637
00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:54.500
Promise, seven o'clock!

638
00:44:56.043 --> 00:44:57.668
Is he going in the right direction?

639
00:44:58.458 --> 00:45:02.250
Yeah, don't worry. This
is the right direction.

640
00:45:02.293 --> 00:45:05.043
We turn right here, and then we go more.

641
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
There!

642
00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:09.083
Oh my god!

643
00:45:09.125 --> 00:45:11.043
Mister, you missed the right turn!

644
00:45:11.418 --> 00:45:12.750
Gas, gas!

645
00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:14.625
I'm going to fill the gas tank!

646
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.625
Goddamn!

647
00:45:18.918 --> 00:45:21.083
Gas…

648
00:45:27.543 --> 00:45:28.875
Stop, stop.

649
00:45:30.833 --> 00:45:32.433
3,000 won's worth, but like a full tank.

650
00:45:33.625 --> 00:45:35.543
Who do you think I am?

651
00:45:36.833 --> 00:45:38.958
I'm not that kind of person!

652
00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.793
What did I just say?

653
00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:46.934
You're not that kind of person.

654
00:45:46.958 --> 00:45:48.875
No, I said 3,000 won.

655
00:45:49.458 --> 00:45:50.458
- Right?
- Yes.

656
00:45:51.583 --> 00:45:54.958
Stop pumping! What, are you crazy?

657
00:45:55.793 --> 00:45:58.168
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong?

658
00:45:58.208 --> 00:46:00.875
I asked for 3,000 won's worth.
3,000 won only!

659
00:46:00.918 --> 00:46:01.918
What?

660
00:46:02.043 --> 00:46:03.958
You think I'm gonna pay more?

661
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.375
I may be an out-of-towner,
but this is outrageous!

662
00:46:06.418 --> 00:46:08.625
I'm only gonna pay 3,000 won.

663
00:46:08.668 --> 00:46:10.833
Look at this guy.

664
00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:14.043
What are you so angry about,

665
00:46:14.083 --> 00:46:17.708
me giving you a bit more gas
when it's all free anyway.

666
00:46:17.958 --> 00:46:22.418
If I filled it full, you'd
have me by the throat.

667
00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:24.708
Free?

668
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.875
Did you think everyone in
Gwang-ju was just like you?

669
00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:30.083
Ouch!

670
00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:40.418
Why didn't you say it's free?
I'd have filled the tank full.

671
00:46:40.458 --> 00:46:44.500
Then fill it before you head back to Seoul.

672
00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.208
Of course! The gas fare to Seoul is costly.

673
00:46:48.293 --> 00:46:49.583
But why is it free?

674
00:46:49.708 --> 00:46:51.333
You saw that taxi at the hospital?

675
00:46:51.625 --> 00:46:54.208
Taxi drivers have one helluva
of a job these days.

676
00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:57.000
Some were arrested
for transporting wounded people.

677
00:46:57.375 --> 00:47:01.708
What's wrong about that?
You can't choose who you take.

678
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.168
That's my point.

679
00:47:03.543 --> 00:47:06.750
We didn't do anything wrong
to be suffering like this.

680
00:47:12.418 --> 00:47:14.793
(Gwang-ju citizens, to
the Provincial Office!)

681
00:47:19.083 --> 00:47:21.168
(Drive out the martial law soldiers!)

682
00:47:21.958 --> 00:47:24.000
That way, mister. Over there.

683
00:47:26.083 --> 00:47:30.293
Citizens of Gwang-ju! We're
all in this together!

684
00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:32.875
Drive out the soldiers!

685
00:47:33.543 --> 00:47:37.333
Drive them out and protect our city!

686
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:47.168
Citizens of Gwang-ju!
Let's all take action!

687
00:47:48.333 --> 00:47:51.168
Coming through! News reporter here!

688
00:47:51.543 --> 00:47:57.333
All the way from Seoul to report,
so please make way.

689
00:47:57.793 --> 00:47:58.958
Thank you, thanks!

690
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.458
That's a reporter!

691
00:48:01.708 --> 00:48:02.918
A foreigner?

692
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:04.958
Thank you!

693
00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:06.875
Flew all the way here?

694
00:48:10.375 --> 00:48:12.000
Make way, people!

695
00:48:20.708 --> 00:48:23.583
Best to set out on a full stomach.
Have some.

696
00:48:23.833 --> 00:48:25.958
What's this? Thank you.

697
00:48:27.375 --> 00:48:29.375
- Hungry? Try one.
- Thank you.

698
00:48:29.418 --> 00:48:31.583
- Is it okay to take this?
- We already ate!

699
00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:33.208
Thanks so much!

700
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:34.918
Thanks to you, too!

701
00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:05.250
Mister, we'll be back in no time.
Why bother?

702
00:49:06.208 --> 00:49:08.793
If my car gets scratched,
are you gonna pay for it?

703
00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:11.458
Hey!

704
00:49:23.418 --> 00:49:26.543
Hello? Where are you from?

705
00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:29.543
ARD Germany. My name is Peter.

706
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.708
I'm Choi, a local reporter.
How did you get here?

707
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:36.668
I heard all the roads to
Gwang-ju are blocked.

708
00:49:36.708 --> 00:49:37.875
I came by taxi.

709
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.543
Live and die together, hoorah hoorah!

710
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.668
We'd rather die standing
than live on our knees!

711
00:49:52.708 --> 00:49:55.418
We fight for justice!

712
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.875
(Afternoon of May 20,
1980 Geumnam Street, Gwang-ju)

713
00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:03.833
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

714
00:50:04.168 --> 00:50:07.583
Citizens of Gwang-ju, citizens of Gwang-ju,

715
00:50:07.625 --> 00:50:09.958
Citizens of Gwang-ju, unite!

716
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.208
Can you hold this?

717
00:50:12.375 --> 00:50:13.668
Yeah, okay sure.

718
00:50:15.708 --> 00:50:17.000
What a jerk.

719
00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:41.083
Wow, Jeolla Province
really does have the best food.

720
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:44.168
Looks simple, but tastes great.

721
00:50:44.543 --> 00:50:45.543
The seasoning is perfect!

722
00:50:45.583 --> 00:50:46.625
Be very careful.

723
00:50:47.458 --> 00:50:51.500
The Korean press is not allowed here,
and foreign press is not welcome.

724
00:50:51.958 --> 00:50:55.625
If they find you are here,
the government will hunt you down.

725
00:50:56.458 --> 00:50:59.000
And the people helping you.

726
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.918
What, you want one?

727
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.918
Have a bite. Nothing happening there.

728
00:51:09.958 --> 00:51:11.043
No, thank you.

729
00:51:11.583 --> 00:51:13.668
Why so serious all of a sudden?

730
00:51:13.833 --> 00:51:14.918
It's nothing.

731
00:52:21.375 --> 00:52:22.708
I have to join them.

732
00:52:22.833 --> 00:52:24.458
Don't get involved, stay here.

733
00:52:25.918 --> 00:52:27.668
How can I just watch?

734
00:52:27.918 --> 00:52:29.793
What difference will it make?

735
00:52:30.418 --> 00:52:31.875
Okay. Let's get down there.

736
00:52:32.125 --> 00:52:33.750
Where? There?

737
00:52:33.793 --> 00:52:36.625
No no no, here stay. There danger.

738
00:52:36.668 --> 00:52:37.668
Here safe.

739
00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:39.125
You stay, we go down.

740
00:52:39.208 --> 00:52:41.293
That guy's just shooting from up here, too.

741
00:52:41.708 --> 00:52:42.833
Where are you going?

742
00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:54.293
What's going on?

743
00:53:01.083 --> 00:53:03.458
Drive out Chun Doo-hwan!

744
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.875
Danger, danger.

745
00:53:14.125 --> 00:53:16.168
If you're gonna shoot, do it from there.

746
00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:17.918
It's too dangerous here.

747
00:53:18.418 --> 00:53:19.833
Let's go, will you?

748
00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:25.208
Are you okay?

749
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:26.250
Sorry sorry!

750
00:53:26.458 --> 00:53:27.644
What the hell is wrong with you?

751
00:53:27.668 --> 00:53:30.625
That's why I said, it's too dangerous here!

752
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.418
- Let's go.
- Don't touch!

753
00:54:17.458 --> 00:54:19.793
Mister, the soldiers have gone crazy.

754
00:54:19.833 --> 00:54:21.625
Hurry up and run!

755
00:54:22.293 --> 00:54:26.168
Damned commie needs to be taught a lesson!

756
00:54:27.083 --> 00:54:28.208
Get rid of him!

757
00:54:31.168 --> 00:54:33.168
Hey, who's that?

758
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:35.250
Get him.

759
00:54:35.418 --> 00:54:39.125
Do you have a death wish? We need to go!

760
00:54:46.668 --> 00:54:48.500
Mister, this way! This way!

761
00:54:48.708 --> 00:54:49.625
Over here!

762
00:54:49.668 --> 00:54:50.668
Hurry!

763
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:25.043
Huh? Isn't she…?

764
00:55:33.543 --> 00:55:34.543
Mister!

765
00:55:40.375 --> 00:55:42.500
Mister, hurry up!

766
00:56:10.083 --> 00:56:12.375
That's why I kept saying danger!

767
00:56:16.125 --> 00:56:17.668
Is that thing expensive?

768
00:56:18.418 --> 00:56:22.043
I've never seen one before.
Should I ask him?

769
00:56:22.083 --> 00:56:24.083
No, don't ask.

770
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:28.500
What? It wasn't my fault.

771
00:56:33.668 --> 00:56:36.000
But why were those
soldiers acting that way?

772
00:56:36.668 --> 00:56:40.625
Beating and chasing people
who weren't doing anything.

773
00:56:41.918 --> 00:56:45.208
I don't know either. We
just don't know why.

774
00:56:46.668 --> 00:56:48.375
Oh god, look at the time.

775
00:56:48.543 --> 00:56:50.208
Hey! Let's go Seoul.

776
00:56:51.668 --> 00:56:53.583
Yeah, okay. Let's go back to Seoul.

777
00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:54.625
Okay, okay.

778
00:56:55.375 --> 00:56:57.708
Then, what about you? We're going to Seoul.

779
00:56:58.418 --> 00:57:02.043
Yes, of course. Then let me off up there.

780
00:57:02.083 --> 00:57:03.125
- Okay.
- Thanks.

781
00:57:10.833 --> 00:57:12.708
Please promise me.

782
00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:15.500
You have to show our news.

783
00:57:17.833 --> 00:57:21.750
Once this footage airs,
the entire world will be watching.

784
00:57:22.625 --> 00:57:23.750
You are not alone.

785
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.125
Thank you so much.

786
00:57:35.043 --> 00:57:37.043
Sir, have a safe trip back.

787
00:57:37.668 --> 00:57:38.918
Wait, kid!

788
00:57:39.875 --> 00:57:41.458
What's your name?

789
00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.543
Jae-sik. Gu Jae-sik.

790
00:57:44.875 --> 00:57:47.500
Gu Jae-sik… Practice hard, okay?

791
00:57:47.543 --> 00:57:49.250
I'll watch your song contest on TV.

792
00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:51.875
Okay.

793
00:57:54.708 --> 00:57:55.793
Have a safe trip.

794
00:58:14.168 --> 00:58:16.543
Come on, not again.

795
00:58:25.375 --> 00:58:26.668
Did it break down?

796
00:58:28.168 --> 00:58:29.168
What happened?

797
00:58:57.375 --> 00:58:58.375
Isn't that…?

798
00:58:58.583 --> 00:59:00.750
I told you it was him! The Seoul driver.

799
00:59:01.208 --> 00:59:02.125
You were right.

800
00:59:02.168 --> 00:59:03.208
Car's broken?

801
00:59:03.668 --> 00:59:05.418
That's bad.

802
00:59:05.918 --> 00:59:07.875
Man, the repair shop's closed.

803
00:59:07.918 --> 00:59:09.500
- Sure is.
- Yeah.

804
00:59:27.793 --> 00:59:29.500
I'm sure they'll fix it soon.

805
00:59:42.458 --> 00:59:43.668
Wow!

806
00:59:45.125 --> 00:59:46.833
Is this your daughter?

807
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.918
Whoa, she's so cute!

808
00:59:49.958 --> 00:59:53.293
You've got hidden talents!
And your wife is pretty too.

809
00:59:54.293 --> 00:59:56.583
What a relief she took after
her mother instead of…

810
01:00:00.375 --> 01:00:03.418
His daughter, huh? Pretty, isn't it?

811
01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:05.583
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to…

812
01:00:05.625 --> 01:00:06.708
No touch!

813
01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:12.958
You ready?

814
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.168
- Yeah, just a sec.
- Okay.

815
01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:16.125
Ready. Try starting it!

816
01:00:16.168 --> 01:00:17.500
Give it a go.

817
01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:29.375
This car already ran over 600,000km!

818
01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:32.708
How'd you drive all the way here?

819
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.625
- The transmission is too old.
- Need to change the starter?

820
01:00:37.168 --> 01:00:38.793
That's a bummer.

821
01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:42.125
I heard the repair shop's all out of parts.

822
01:00:44.543 --> 01:00:48.793
What about parts from another car?
He can have mine.

823
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.708
I changed my starter recently,
so better switch with mine.

824
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:57.293
Then, leave it here for now.

825
01:00:57.333 --> 01:01:01.543
I'll find a way to make
it run a short distance.

826
01:01:01.583 --> 01:01:02.875
How long will it take?

827
01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.168
I need to be in Seoul before the curfew.

828
01:01:06.418 --> 01:01:08.833
- It'll take at least 2 hours.
- Yeah.

829
01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:11.000
Better leave for Seoul tomorrow.

830
01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:13.168
Curfew here is 9 o'clock.

831
01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:15.418
You don't want to be out past curfew.

832
01:01:16.418 --> 01:01:18.168
- Is there a phone somewhere?
- What for?

833
01:01:18.583 --> 01:01:21.125
Those bastards have cut
all the phone lines.

834
01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:22.168
What?

835
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.043
Isn't there any way? I need to call home.

836
01:01:29.083 --> 01:01:31.543
What're you so worried about?

837
01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:34.168
If a man's out working,
he can stay out a night or two.

838
01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:38.875
My daughter's home alone.
And she's only 11.

839
01:01:38.918 --> 01:01:40.833
Then where's her mom?

840
01:01:40.918 --> 01:01:41.833
What?

841
01:01:41.875 --> 01:01:43.333
Oh, that poor thing.

842
01:01:44.043 --> 01:01:45.958
Too young to be alone…

843
01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:50.625
Oh my.

844
01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:58.083
Mr. Kim, if it's about money,
let me pay for the repairs.

845
01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.000
You bastard, did I ask you for money?

846
01:02:05.668 --> 01:02:07.625
You knew everything, right?

847
01:02:07.668 --> 01:02:09.250
Danger, you knew it!

848
01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.375
Why are you yelling at me?

849
01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:11.934
It's not my fault your car broke down.

850
01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:14.038
And you knew exactly that
it would be dangerous here!

851
01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.668
What's this prick saying?

852
01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:19.583
Mister, calm down! He
says you knew the danger.

853
01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:21.625
Bullshit! Like hell I did!

854
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:24.918
And why do you keep
taking this foreigner's side, huh?

855
01:02:24.958 --> 01:02:26.208
What?

856
01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:27.833
Just take the money.

857
01:02:27.875 --> 01:02:29.793
Take the money. Take the money, here.

858
01:02:29.958 --> 01:02:31.583
Get that away from me!

859
01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:32.625
Get it away!

860
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.125
Oh my.

861
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:41.250
Just stop it!

862
01:02:42.208 --> 01:02:44.043
Just calm down, stop it!

863
01:02:46.793 --> 01:02:48.793
My, oh my…

864
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.418
His young daughter at home alone.

865
01:03:11.918 --> 01:03:15.083
But he can't go back to Seoul.
He cannot call.

866
01:03:18.125 --> 01:03:21.543
Jürgen Hinzpeter, Asia Correspondent
for Germany's public broadcaster.

867
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.418
He came in from Japan.

868
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.958
What are those assholes
in the security service doing?

869
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:36.793
He entered without registering as
a reporter, so they missed him.

870
01:03:37.583 --> 01:03:39.918
He declared himself a missionary.

871
01:03:40.418 --> 01:03:43.708
He seems to have planned the whole thing.

872
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:48.625
He's using a Seoul taxi,
so we'll find him soon.

873
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.833
So that's where you live… the corner house?

874
01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:53.125
Yes, next to it.

875
01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:55.293
We're almost here.

876
01:04:02.168 --> 01:04:03.375
Come on, hurry.

877
01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:09.208
Honey? I'm home!

878
01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:12.125
Dad!

879
01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:14.875
Goodness, why are you back so late?

880
01:04:14.918 --> 01:04:16.333
There was a lot going on.

881
01:04:17.043 --> 01:04:19.918
Did you stay up waiting for Daddy?

882
01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:22.583
Who are they?

883
01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:25.083
It's a long story. Can you make us dinner?

884
01:04:25.458 --> 01:04:29.333
- Yes, but not much to eat.
- Fine with just kimchi.

885
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.875
Come on, let's go in. Please…

886
01:04:34.418 --> 01:04:35.958
It's okay if we have kimchi…

887
01:04:36.793 --> 01:04:38.043
Get in!

888
01:04:45.458 --> 01:04:46.543
Oh, my!

889
01:04:47.543 --> 01:04:50.750
Is this all we've got for
such important guests?

890
01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:59.458
Don't worry. Your neighbor will
look after your daughter.

891
01:05:00.043 --> 01:05:03.293
You can call her on the
way tomorrow morning.

892
01:05:03.793 --> 01:05:04.793
Yes.

893
01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:06.708
Dad, I'm hungry.

894
01:05:07.083 --> 01:05:09.583
Oh, go ahead and eat. You're hungry?

895
01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:13.918
Try this first. My wife made it.

896
01:05:13.958 --> 01:05:17.375
It's crisp, slightly bitter,
but with a real kick…

897
01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:20.418
Not sure if it's your
style, but please try.

898
01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.750
Give it a try.

899
01:05:26.333 --> 01:05:27.333
That's hot!

900
01:05:27.375 --> 01:05:29.125
This is spicy, hot.

901
01:05:29.168 --> 01:05:31.458
Oh, not a problem. I can handle spicy.

902
01:05:36.793 --> 01:05:38.083
Wow, he eats well.

903
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.668
Oh my god. This is a shock.

904
01:05:40.918 --> 01:05:41.918
Wasser!

905
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:44.000
- What?
- Water!

906
01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:49.875
Too spicy for him!

907
01:05:50.793 --> 01:05:51.500
Hot!

908
01:05:51.543 --> 01:05:54.668
No wonder. He ate it too easy.

909
01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:59.250
What are you laughing for?

910
01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:03.668
You come to a foreign country,
break a camera, eat kimchi.

911
01:06:03.708 --> 01:06:05.543
You've been through a lot, too.

912
01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:10.708
Why'd you come here?

913
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:12.125
Why you come here?

914
01:06:13.293 --> 01:06:14.293
Reporter.

915
01:06:15.083 --> 01:06:16.208
Was that English?

916
01:06:17.208 --> 01:06:19.793
Seoul drivers speak English?

917
01:06:19.833 --> 01:06:21.083
I'm a reporter.

918
01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:23.918
Reporters go wherever there is news.

919
01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:26.500
Then try translating what he just said.

920
01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:35.168
I'm a reporter here
for the news something like that…

921
01:06:36.833 --> 01:06:37.875
Is that right?

922
01:06:38.418 --> 01:06:39.418
Yes.

923
01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:44.250
You're amazing. I never would've guessed!

924
01:06:45.043 --> 01:06:46.043
Ah…

925
01:06:46.875 --> 01:06:48.625
Why you become a reporter?

926
01:06:50.208 --> 01:06:53.375
What's that, a poker card?
I used to play, too…

927
01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:56.418
Not that, money. He means money.

928
01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:58.793
He means he did it because of the money?

929
01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.083
Yes.

930
01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:03.375
Where do you spend your money?

931
01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:11.875
A hole in your sock.

932
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:16.583
He acts like such a big shot,
but I guess he's not.

933
01:07:16.793 --> 01:07:19.500
How can you be worse off
than a widower like me?

934
01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.543
(Martial Law Soldiers
Massacre Civilians in Gwang-ju)

935
01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:32.458
Now that's a real newspaper!

936
01:07:33.458 --> 01:07:37.375
There's no turning back after this.
So if anyone…

937
01:07:37.418 --> 01:07:39.168
Are you the only reporter here?

938
01:07:39.625 --> 01:07:41.668
We've all made up our minds.

939
01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:45.293
Open the door!

940
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.000
Are you trying to close us down?

941
01:08:07.043 --> 01:08:11.250
But Chief! We're reporters, aren't we?

942
01:08:11.293 --> 01:08:15.333
Shouldn't we at least
try to tell the people

943
01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:20.000
what's happening here and why?

944
01:08:20.043 --> 01:08:22.043
What will happen then?

945
01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:27.125
They will shut us down,
and drag us all off!

946
01:08:27.168 --> 01:08:29.418
Come on, get them out!

947
01:08:31.418 --> 01:08:33.083
Let go! Chief! Chief!

948
01:08:37.958 --> 01:08:40.833
Will this stop bullets?

949
01:08:41.543 --> 01:08:45.375
Of course not. It's to cover the lights.

950
01:08:45.418 --> 01:08:46.500
Right.

951
01:08:47.543 --> 01:08:48.958
It's time for evening news.

952
01:08:49.543 --> 01:08:53.458
Why bother watching useless crap?

953
01:08:53.793 --> 01:08:56.958
Who knows, maybe they'll
say something today.

954
01:08:58.168 --> 01:08:59.833
I doubt it…

955
01:09:02.793 --> 01:09:04.226
- The disturbance in Gwang-ju…
- It's on.

956
01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.918
Is not yet contained…

957
01:09:05.958 --> 01:09:08.000
- Have some fruit.
- Hey, quiet!

958
01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:13.750
…with student radicals
and gangsters gathering in Gwang-ju

959
01:09:13.793 --> 01:09:18.125
and spreading groundless rumors.

960
01:09:18.168 --> 01:09:22.333
To date, 1 civilian has been killed,
and 5 members of the military…

961
01:09:23.375 --> 01:09:24.500
Those fuckers!

962
01:09:24.543 --> 01:09:25.543
Honey!

963
01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:29.043
How can they say that?
So many people died today!

964
01:09:29.375 --> 01:09:31.875
Is the news just allowed to lie like that?

965
01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.375
Why did we have to watch that crap?

966
01:09:35.543 --> 01:09:37.583
God that sets me off!

967
01:09:39.168 --> 01:09:40.333
That's not true.

968
01:09:43.208 --> 01:09:47.418
As soon as I get back to Japan,
my footage will hit the news.

969
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.458
The whole world will see.

970
01:09:52.418 --> 01:09:55.168
Mr. Kim will take me back
to the airport, and…

971
01:09:58.250 --> 01:10:02.250
Anyhow without him,
I would have never made it to Gwang-ju.

972
01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:10.458
He can broadcast it when he
gets to Japan, with Mr. Kim's help.

973
01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:16.458
And Mr. Kim also helped him get pass
the soldiers blocking the roads.

974
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:21.543
You're amazing. Both of you.

975
01:10:23.083 --> 01:10:26.583
Well, a driver has to go
where the customer says.

976
01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:27.583
Don't worry, don't worry.

977
01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:29.833
I'll take you right to
the airport tomorrow.

978
01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:31.250
Airport, okay?

979
01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:35.625
By the sound of it,
I should plead to both of you…

980
01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:38.458
Please make this work.

981
01:10:38.583 --> 01:10:41.958
I'd beg you on my knees, really!

982
01:10:42.125 --> 01:10:45.000
No, I'm really good at that.

983
01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.293
On my knees!

984
01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.333
Forget that.

985
01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:52.958
Sing us a song instead.
He's entering a song contest.

986
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.918
We'll judge if you deserve
a prize, so sing!

987
01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:57.750
- Oh, no way!
- Please.

988
01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.583
I do guitar, not vocals.

989
01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.458
What's the difference?

990
01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:05.043
Give him a hand!

991
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:11.918
What should I do?

992
01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.875
Wow, looking good!

993
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.793
What can I do if you leave me like this?

994
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.208
What can I do to go on living without you?

995
01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:43.750
What? Why ring the gong?

996
01:11:43.793 --> 01:11:49.043
Students may protest against you,
to stop you from singing.

997
01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:53.043
I told you, I play guitar!
But I'm not that bad!

998
01:11:53.668 --> 01:11:55.168
I shouldn't have asked him to sing.

999
01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:56.583
Is that a new song?

1000
01:11:59.958 --> 01:12:01.875
I guess I'm no good.

1001
01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.500
You're really not a singer.

1002
01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.793
But there's something striking about him.

1003
01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:13.543
See, I told you!

1004
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:17.293
Oh, my. He looks just like your brother.

1005
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.958
- That's right!
- Yes, they're similar!

1006
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.833
- You mean Sang-chul?
- Yeah.

1007
01:12:22.958 --> 01:12:24.125
Who?

1008
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:27.793
Right, why didn't I see it before?

1009
01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:31.918
I have a younger brother.

1010
01:12:31.958 --> 01:12:34.293
You look just like him.

1011
01:12:34.918 --> 01:12:36.583
What do you think? Same-same?

1012
01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.309
- What do you mean?
- He looks like my husband.

1013
01:12:38.333 --> 01:12:39.333
Same, same.

1014
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.208
I look like Peter, right?

1015
01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.250
Oh no!

1016
01:12:43.833 --> 01:12:44.918
What's that?

1017
01:12:46.583 --> 01:12:47.708
What's this sound?

1018
01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:01.418
That's by the TV station.

1019
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:03.375
Yeah, I think so.

1020
01:13:03.418 --> 01:13:08.000
Bro! People are gathering
over by the TV station!

1021
01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:11.083
The taxi drivers are all
heading there, too.

1022
01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.958
- Really?
- I'll see you there.

1023
01:13:15.333 --> 01:13:18.543
(Night of May 20, 1980
Near Gwang-ju MBC TV Station)

1024
01:13:54.043 --> 01:13:55.918
The foreign reporter! Get the radio!

1025
01:14:25.125 --> 01:14:26.293
Jae-sik!

1026
01:14:36.793 --> 01:14:38.543
Mister, look out!

1027
01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.418
They're plainclothes soldiers!

1028
01:14:42.793 --> 01:14:43.958
What? Plainclothes?

1029
01:14:56.208 --> 01:14:57.500
Damned commies!

1030
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.583
Go hide up there. I'll bring it up.

1031
01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:29.958
Hurry!

1032
01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:48.583
Where is he?

1033
01:15:49.918 --> 01:15:53.333
He didn't come this way.

1034
01:16:03.333 --> 01:16:04.458
Hello!

1035
01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:09.708
I know you're up there.

1036
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.293
Mister.

1037
01:16:14.168 --> 01:16:17.043
If you give me the camera and film,

1038
01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:19.043
you two,

1039
01:16:19.293 --> 01:16:20.333
no…

1040
01:16:22.958 --> 01:16:25.500
the three of you including this kid…

1041
01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.418
can go free.

1042
01:16:30.375 --> 01:16:31.375
What is he saying?

1043
01:16:43.543 --> 01:16:45.543
I'll count to ten.

1044
01:16:47.293 --> 01:16:49.083
And I'll let you decide

1045
01:16:50.918 --> 01:16:52.583
what the wise choice is.

1046
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.418
He wants this.

1047
01:16:55.583 --> 01:16:58.043
Then we can live, and Jae-sik too.

1048
01:16:58.625 --> 01:16:59.668
Give safe.

1049
01:17:00.418 --> 01:17:03.043
Let's give it to him.

1050
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:04.875
One

1051
01:17:06.208 --> 01:17:07.375
two

1052
01:17:13.875 --> 01:17:15.125

1053

four

1054

five

1055
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.918
- What are you doing?
- Six

1056
01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:28.043
seven

1057
01:17:30.793 --> 01:17:32.000
eight

1058

nine

1059
01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:37.958
Wait a minute!

1060
01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:44.500
The foreign reporter might be close by.

1061
01:17:44.668 --> 01:17:47.418
Let me speak in English to him.

1062
01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.043
I'll beg him to save me.

1063
01:18:07.293 --> 01:18:08.875
Can you hear me?

1064
01:18:13.208 --> 01:18:15.668
I can't hold this soldier much longer.

1065
01:18:20.418 --> 01:18:21.583
So please,

1066
01:18:23.168 --> 01:18:26.375
go now and show the world
what's happening in here.

1067
01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:31.083
- Where are you going?
- So please…

1068
01:18:31.125 --> 01:18:32.418
We need to give him this.

1069
01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.500
They're coming up!

1070
01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:38.833
Hey!

1071
01:18:43.418 --> 01:18:44.418
Damn!

1072
01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:46.708
Give me the bag!

1073
01:18:50.750 --> 01:18:51.833
Get away!

1074
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.125
I'm okay!

1075
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Over there!

1076
01:18:57.168 --> 01:18:58.168
Get him!

1077
01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:18.708
There!

1078
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.375
Where's the damn reporter?

1079
01:20:47.583 --> 01:20:49.875
Where are you running, commie?

1080
01:20:50.375 --> 01:20:52.875
Spare me, I'm not a commie!

1081
01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:58.958
You prick! Damn commie!

1082
01:21:04.458 --> 01:21:05.918
I'm really not a commie!

1083
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.000
I'm not even from Gwang-ju. I'm from Seoul.

1084
01:21:09.043 --> 01:21:12.708
# 10-8, Hwayang-dong 384,
Sungdong-gu, Seoul.

1085
01:21:16.333 --> 01:21:17.750
Yeah.

1086
01:21:19.168 --> 01:21:20.208
I know.

1087
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.918
The Seoul taxi.

1088
01:21:24.668 --> 01:21:27.500
You're that commie who
brought in the German reporter.

1089
01:21:27.875 --> 01:21:31.083
The shit bastard who sold
his country for money!

1090
01:21:32.543 --> 01:21:35.418
And yet you say, "I'm not a commie!"

1091
01:21:35.875 --> 01:21:37.750
"I'm not a commie!"

1092
01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:39.375
"I'm not a commie!"

1093
01:21:39.418 --> 01:21:41.293
"I'm not a commie!"

1094
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.125
How dare you…

1095
01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:08.875
We have to get out of here.

1096
01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:21.418
My god, I was so worried!

1097
01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:25.668
I'm glad you made it back.
But where's Jae-sik?

1098
01:22:26.793 --> 01:22:28.208
Wasn't he with you?

1099
01:22:29.543 --> 01:22:30.543
Huh?

1100
01:22:58.543 --> 01:22:59.708
You know…

1101
01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:06.750
I earned some money in Saudi Arabia.

1102
01:23:09.333 --> 01:23:13.293
But my wife got sick
and I spent it all on hospital bills.

1103
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:18.625
At the end, my wife insisted
that I buy that taxi.

1104
01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.833
And the doctor said so too,

1105
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:30.293
so I should look after our daughter.

1106
01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:39.918
We could have tried more meds,

1107
01:23:44.833 --> 01:23:49.000
but I didn't argue. That's
the kind of guy I am.

1108
01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.293
The rest have to go on living, right?

1109
01:23:59.293 --> 01:24:03.083
Because after my wife died,
I got drunk every day.

1110
01:24:12.293 --> 01:24:17.500
One day I woke up,

1111
01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:29.583
she was crying holding onto
her mom's old clothes.

1112
01:24:37.668 --> 01:24:39.668
She must have missed her so much.

1113
01:24:47.293 --> 01:24:50.458
I quit drinking that day.

1114
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.875
I'm the only one she has left.

1115
01:26:07.918 --> 01:26:09.208
What are you doing?

1116
01:26:11.668 --> 01:26:15.043
The paratroopers are
searching for a Seoul taxi!

1117
01:26:15.418 --> 01:26:18.500
Should've said you're going.
You don't even know the roads!

1118
01:26:18.918 --> 01:26:21.833
Here, take this and…

1119
01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:30.750
These are hidden roads out of Gwang-ju.

1120
01:26:33.043 --> 01:26:36.208
And the reporter asked me to give you this.

1121
01:26:37.043 --> 01:26:39.125
How can I accept that?

1122
01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:40.333
What?

1123
01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:44.043
If a driver took a passenger,
he should accept the fare!

1124
01:26:44.168 --> 01:26:46.000
Just take it.

1125
01:26:46.793 --> 01:26:48.708
I can't take that money.

1126
01:26:48.793 --> 01:26:52.043
Just the repairs will cost you a lot.

1127
01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:54.458
Don't argue. Just take it!

1128
01:26:56.625 --> 01:26:57.833
On your way, now.

1129
01:26:58.333 --> 01:27:01.458
Your daughter must have
waited all night. Hurry.

1130
01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:07.333
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1131
01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.043
Why are you sorry?

1132
01:27:13.543 --> 01:27:15.458
Bastards out there should be.

1133
01:27:24.543 --> 01:27:27.918
It's damn fine weather.

1134
01:27:32.793 --> 01:27:36.833
Come visit with your daughter someday.

1135
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.333
We'll take my son and go on a picnic.

1136
01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:44.000
Take care of yourself.

1137
01:27:48.583 --> 01:27:49.958
You take care.

1138
01:28:46.418 --> 01:28:48.333
It'll take an hour to fix it.

1139
01:28:48.833 --> 01:28:50.625
Don't stay cramped in here.

1140
01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:55.418
There's a Buddha's day celebration
or something like that over there.

1141
01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:56.918
Go take a walk around.

1142
01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:58.208
Can I use the phone?

1143
01:29:12.918 --> 01:29:13.708
Hello?

1144
01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:15.458
Dong-su, is my daughter there?

1145
01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.375
Where have you been?

1146
01:29:17.418 --> 01:29:18.543
Is she with you?

1147
01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:21.625
She just fell asleep. Wake her up?

1148
01:29:21.668 --> 01:29:23.418
No, let her sleep.

1149
01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.375
Is she okay?

1150
01:29:25.918 --> 01:29:28.918
If you're so worried, why did you stay out?

1151
01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:31.625
Did you really get that money?

1152
01:29:31.668 --> 01:29:32.793
Give me the phone.

1153
01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:36.375
Mr. Kim! Where are you?

1154
01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:38.125
I'm…

1155
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.958
I'm in the countryside
and my car broke down.

1156
01:29:42.418 --> 01:29:46.708
I left 2,000 won in my drawer.
Please give it to Eunjung…

1157
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:51.458
She's been up all night waiting,
so why make promises!

1158
01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:53.333
Hey, give me the phone!

1159
01:29:53.918 --> 01:29:57.793
You'll be back soon? Let's talk then.
Stop it!

1160
01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:17.875
Hello!

1161
01:30:21.918 --> 01:30:23.418
How old is your daughter?

1162
01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:24.250
Eleven.

1163
01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:26.918
Then how about these?

1164
01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:32.000
These are sturdy and nice. Moms love them.

1165
01:30:32.168 --> 01:30:33.543
They're really popular!

1166
01:30:35.875 --> 01:30:40.125
If she's 11, she'll need size 200…

1167
01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.708
Give me size 210.

1168
01:30:42.083 --> 01:30:44.000
Size 200 is getting small for her.

1169
01:30:44.043 --> 01:30:48.833
What a thoughtful father.
You know her shoe size!

1170
01:30:50.375 --> 01:30:52.543
Those are a bit expensive…

1171
01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:00.293
A bowl of noodles, please.

1172
01:31:05.583 --> 01:31:08.293
Huh? I thought you went bill collecting?

1173
01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:10.583
Ended up wasting my time.

1174
01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:12.418
Ma'am, another bottle of soju!

1175
01:31:12.458 --> 01:31:13.333
Sure.

1176
01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:15.668
What, people wouldn't pay?

1177
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:18.168
I couldn't even get into Gwang-ju.

1178
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:22.043
I heard people were killed
in Gwang-ju, I guess it's true!

1179
01:31:22.708 --> 01:31:24.000
People were killed?

1180
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:28.418
Yeah, soldiers raided the city,
and all hell broke loose.

1181
01:31:28.458 --> 01:31:29.375
What are you talking about?

1182
01:31:29.418 --> 01:31:30.793
I don't know for sure,

1183
01:31:30.875 --> 01:31:36.083
but I heard many people were killed,
and a whole bunch arrested.

1184
01:31:36.125 --> 01:31:38.418
That's not it.

1185
01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:43.250
A few innocent soldiers were killed in
violent college student protests.

1186
01:31:43.293 --> 01:31:47.793
No, someone really saw
people getting killed there.

1187
01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:49.500
It was in the news.

1188
01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:53.793
Not just students, but hardcore Communists.

1189
01:31:53.833 --> 01:31:56.083
They even brought gangsters from Seoul!

1190
01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:59.668
Really? It was in the news?

1191
01:32:00.293 --> 01:32:01.625
Yeah!

1192
01:32:01.793 --> 01:32:04.668
It's in the newspaper
too, a full-page story.

1193
01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:09.208
If they want to protest,
why not just do it in Seoul?

1194
01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.833
(Protests in Gwang-ju)
Keeping me from doing my job.

1195
01:32:14.793 --> 01:32:18.543
(Rogue Groups and Rioters…)

1196
01:32:47.583 --> 01:32:52.375
You must've been really hungry.
Have this, too.

1197
01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:05.208
It's delicious… Delicious.

1198
01:33:13.668 --> 01:33:15.543
Taxi, taxi!

1199
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.918
So pretty.

1200
01:33:25.668 --> 01:33:29.083
Always bought her sneakers,
never a nice pair of shoes…

1201
01:33:29.708 --> 01:33:31.583
Eun-jung will love these.

1202
01:33:37.043 --> 01:33:41.668
The river water flows

1203
01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:45.625
under the 3rd Han River Bridge

1204
01:33:47.375 --> 01:33:52.333
Like a bird, like wind, like water

1205
01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:56.375
it continues to flow.

1206
01:33:56.918 --> 01:34:01.583
Yesterday I met you again

1207
01:34:02.543 --> 01:34:07.458
and we struck a solemn vow.

1208
01:34:08.375 --> 01:34:12.500
That in the morning we'd
take the first train

1209
01:34:16.583 --> 01:34:21.668
and leave together…

1210
01:34:41.293 --> 01:34:44.043
Eun-jung, what should I do?

1211
01:34:45.250 --> 01:34:46.418
What do I do?

1212
01:35:08.418 --> 01:35:10.043
One more phone call, please.

1213
01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:13.458
Eun-jung, are you awake?

1214
01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:16.083
Daddy, are we going on a picnic?

1215
01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:19.708
Sorry, there's something I need to do.

1216
01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:22.168
Let's go another time.

1217
01:35:23.625 --> 01:35:24.875
When?

1218
01:35:26.708 --> 01:35:30.750
I left a customer behind.

1219
01:35:32.043 --> 01:35:34.833
Someone who really needs to take my taxi.

1220
01:35:36.125 --> 01:35:38.125
I'll come home right after.

1221
01:35:38.168 --> 01:35:41.583
So, be nice and don't fight with Sang-gu.

1222
01:35:56.418 --> 01:36:07.458
Until Mt. Baekdu is worn away
and the East Sea's waters run dry,

1223
01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:17.208
God protect and preserve our country.

1224
01:36:25.833 --> 01:36:26.875
Where has he gone?

1225
01:36:27.625 --> 01:36:28.708
To the hospital.

1226
01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:31.083
The hospital?

1227
01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:12.458
Why are you back?

1228
01:37:37.958 --> 01:37:40.875
The paratroopers dragged him off,

1229
01:37:43.418 --> 01:37:46.875
and he died on the way.

1230
01:37:48.793 --> 01:37:52.043
So they just threw him in a rice field.

1231
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.875
There aren't enough coffins in Gwang-ju.

1232
01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:01.418
So some students went to get more…

1233
01:38:43.543 --> 01:38:44.793
Why are you sitting there?

1234
01:38:47.708 --> 01:38:50.000
You need to record all this.

1235
01:38:56.958 --> 01:38:59.168
You promised, to tell people.

1236
01:39:00.458 --> 01:39:04.958
It needs to be broadcast
so people will know.

1237
01:39:06.793 --> 01:39:08.500
You're a reporter, shoot this.

1238
01:39:09.668 --> 01:39:12.625
Jae-sik, and this too.

1239
01:39:13.458 --> 01:39:14.500
Here.

1240
01:39:59.125 --> 01:40:00.750
Open your eyes!

1241
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.125
How can you leave me.

1242
01:40:11.543 --> 01:40:14.125
And our unborn baby!

1243
01:40:25.958 --> 01:40:27.293
Make way!

1244
01:40:27.793 --> 01:40:30.458
Over here, Doctor! Please help over here.

1245
01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:31.750
He's been shot.

1246
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.125
Bro, what do we do?

1247
01:40:36.458 --> 01:40:40.125
They're really trying to wipe us all out!

1248
01:40:40.168 --> 01:40:42.208
People were singing the national anthem,

1249
01:40:42.708 --> 01:40:45.208
when the paratroopers
just started shooting.

1250
01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:47.543
God, so many people have been shot!

1251
01:40:47.918 --> 01:40:49.918
We need to get there.

1252
01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.543
You two go to Seoul, quickly.

1253
01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:54.418
I'm coming with you!

1254
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:58.208
Mr. Kim, you go back to Seoul.
I need to keep filming.

1255
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:59.375
Hey, hey.

1256
01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:00.833
You paid me the fare.

1257
01:41:01.458 --> 01:41:02.750
We go together.

1258
01:41:03.208 --> 01:41:04.458
I taxi driver,

1259
01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:06.333
You taxi customer.

1260
01:41:07.293 --> 01:41:08.293
Okay?

1261
01:41:08.918 --> 01:41:10.208
Okay! together.

1262
01:41:47.458 --> 01:41:49.208
(Dear citizens of Gwang-ju.)

1263
01:41:49.250 --> 01:41:51.090
(One, stay at home.
Two, don't believe rumors.)

1264
01:41:51.918 --> 01:41:52.958
He needs hospital, now!

1265
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.418
Get ahold of yourself!

1266
01:42:04.168 --> 01:42:06.793
Why are they shooting us?

1267
01:42:14.833 --> 01:42:16.625
Don't go out.

1268
01:42:21.875 --> 01:42:23.333
My god, look at that.

1269
01:42:24.958 --> 01:42:26.958
What's going on here?

1270
01:42:31.293 --> 01:42:32.833
Over there! She's shot!

1271
01:43:05.708 --> 01:43:07.125
Get a hold of yourself!

1272
01:43:31.708 --> 01:43:33.833
How can they just shoot people?

1273
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.583
How can they do this to us?

1274
01:43:38.875 --> 01:43:40.750
How many times has it been?

1275
01:43:41.583 --> 01:43:43.543
They really plan to kill us all!

1276
01:43:43.583 --> 01:43:47.125
We can't leave injured people like that!

1277
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:52.583
That's it. Let's drive our taxis in.

1278
01:43:53.625 --> 01:43:54.750
Wait…

1279
01:43:59.543 --> 01:44:00.543
Here.

1280
01:44:02.333 --> 01:44:05.293
I can drive well. Let's go together.

1281
01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:37.543
Look! The taxi drivers!

1282
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.083
Thank you.

1283
01:45:54.375 --> 01:45:55.500
Young-pyo!

1284
01:45:57.168 --> 01:45:59.418
- Young-pyo!
- Are you okay?

1285
01:45:59.958 --> 01:46:01.125
Hey, duck down.

1286
01:46:01.168 --> 01:46:02.333
Let's help them!

1287
01:46:03.958 --> 01:46:06.625
Let's save the wounded! Come on!

1288
01:46:13.668 --> 01:46:16.125
- Don't lose focus.
- Come here.

1289
01:46:18.125 --> 01:46:19.125
Are you okay?

1290
01:46:20.293 --> 01:46:21.625
Please help me!

1291
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:29.583
Bro, get in here!

1292
01:46:30.918 --> 01:46:32.000
Gently!

1293
01:46:52.708 --> 01:46:54.418
Here, over here!

1294
01:46:54.958 --> 01:46:56.043
Hold on a sec.

1295
01:48:49.208 --> 01:48:50.583
You need to go now.

1296
01:48:51.125 --> 01:48:52.333
They're getting closer.

1297
01:48:52.375 --> 01:48:55.125
You have to go now.
Or it will be impossible.

1298
01:48:55.668 --> 01:48:57.875
Let us take care of this.

1299
01:48:58.375 --> 01:49:03.293
Go back, and please,
prove all their lies wrong!

1300
01:49:03.333 --> 01:49:07.208
We cannot do it, but you can.
Please, for us.

1301
01:49:12.543 --> 01:49:15.418
Go quickly! Things are getting bad here.

1302
01:50:21.168 --> 01:50:23.000
Mr. Kim, we must go now.

1303
01:50:49.833 --> 01:50:51.043
Block all checkpoints.

1304
01:51:07.918 --> 01:51:09.043
Can you get us out?

1305
01:51:11.875 --> 01:51:12.875
Don't worry.

1306
01:51:14.458 --> 01:51:16.668
I'll get you to the airport no matter what.

1307
01:52:04.418 --> 01:52:05.668
Good afternoon.

1308
01:52:07.333 --> 01:52:08.418
Where are you going?

1309
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.668
I'm taking a customer to Seoul.

1310
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:11.833
Is it a Seoul taxi?

1311
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:13.293
No, a Gwang-ju taxi.

1312
01:52:15.625 --> 01:52:16.708
Where's your home?

1313
01:52:18.293 --> 01:52:19.418
Why?

1314
01:52:19.458 --> 01:52:21.500
Answer, you bastard!

1315
01:52:22.333 --> 01:52:24.293
And why don't you have a Gwang-ju accent?

1316
01:52:25.708 --> 01:52:27.793
I moved here not long ago.

1317
01:52:28.750 --> 01:52:31.625
What's going on? Why are you stopping us?

1318
01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:38.250
Hey, college boy! What's
this bastard saying?

1319
01:52:40.958 --> 01:52:42.208
Where are you going?

1320
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:44.293
I'm here on business.

1321
01:52:44.333 --> 01:52:47.375
But it's so dangerous in Gwang-ju,
you know all these riots?

1322
01:52:47.833 --> 01:52:49.668
So we go back to Seoul.

1323
01:52:50.293 --> 01:52:52.500
He came on business
but leaving to escape the riots.

1324
01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:01.543
Both of you, out of the car.

1325
01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:04.168
I don't understand. What's the problem?

1326
01:53:05.168 --> 01:53:06.168
Get out now.

1327
01:53:06.875 --> 01:53:10.500
Being a foreigner won't save you. Get out.

1328
01:53:32.293 --> 01:53:33.500
Open the trunk.

1329
01:53:58.250 --> 01:54:00.333
These are his souvenirs.

1330
01:54:00.583 --> 01:54:02.208
From Buddha's Birthday.

1331
01:54:33.293 --> 01:54:34.293
Let them through.

1332
01:54:37.208 --> 01:54:39.583
Sergeant, we have to stop all foreigners.

1333
01:54:39.625 --> 01:54:42.168
He's not a reporter, and
it's not a Seoul taxi.

1334
01:54:43.125 --> 01:54:44.125
Let them through.

1335
01:54:48.250 --> 01:54:49.625
I said, let them through.

1336
01:54:51.125 --> 01:54:52.125
Yes, sir.

1337
01:55:19.458 --> 01:55:21.333
They said to stop taxis with foreigners!

1338
01:55:21.375 --> 01:55:22.668
Hey, close it!

1339
01:55:32.333 --> 01:55:34.625
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1340
01:55:34.668 --> 01:55:36.083
Plate number 0310.

1341
01:55:36.793 --> 01:55:39.083
A-34, A-34. Car with foreigner on the run.

1342
01:55:39.125 --> 01:55:41.875
Plate number 0310.

1343
01:57:01.208 --> 01:57:02.583
This is awesome.

1344
01:57:12.958 --> 01:57:14.041
Run them over.

1345
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:28.791
Bastards!

1346
01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:30.625
Shoot them all!

1347
01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:33.250
Damn it!

1348
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.041
Bro, go faster!

1349
01:57:44.333 --> 01:57:45.958
Don't worry about me!

1350
01:58:20.958 --> 01:58:23.458
Come on bastards, let's go at it!

1351
01:58:47.041 --> 01:58:48.583
What's going on back there?

1352
01:59:07.416 --> 01:59:08.750
I'm sorry…

1353
01:59:26.083 --> 01:59:27.625
Take care of yourself!

1354
01:59:28.083 --> 01:59:29.791
Don't worry about us!

1355
02:00:00.583 --> 02:00:01.708
Step on it.

1356
02:00:02.375 --> 02:00:03.375
Step on it!

1357
02:01:50.041 --> 02:01:53.250
Yes, we're searching everywhere.
Don't worry, sir.

1358
02:01:53.291 --> 02:01:56.083
He called the airport just now
and reserved a flight.

1359
02:01:57.666 --> 02:01:59.041
Commander, we found him!

1360
02:01:59.083 --> 02:02:01.333
He booked the 10am plane to Japan tomorrow.

1361
02:02:02.458 --> 02:02:03.833
Yes, sir!

1362
02:02:03.875 --> 02:02:04.875
Hi.

1363
02:02:07.208 --> 02:02:08.166
Mr.Hinzpeter?

1364
02:02:08.208 --> 02:02:09.208
Yes.

1365
02:02:10.958 --> 02:02:15.166
Our system shows that you have a flight
booked for tomorrow at 10am?

1366
02:02:15.208 --> 02:02:17.333
Yes, but I'm somehow here today,

1367
02:02:17.375 --> 02:02:22.333
so I'd like to get onto the first flight
out to Japan and make it first class.

1368
02:03:06.791 --> 02:03:07.791
For your daughter.

1369
02:03:08.916 --> 02:03:10.125
This is for me?

1370
02:03:11.125 --> 02:03:12.125
Thank you.

1371
02:03:13.333 --> 02:03:15.000
Please give me your phone number.

1372
02:03:15.625 --> 02:03:16.541
What?

1373
02:03:16.583 --> 02:03:19.208
Your taxi. I'd like to
pay for all the damage.

1374
02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:23.500
I'll get the news broadcast,
then come right back to Korea.

1375
02:03:24.083 --> 02:03:25.708
I'll call you when I return.

1376
02:03:30.208 --> 02:03:32.291
Ah, I forgot to buy cigarettes.

1377
02:03:34.541 --> 02:03:35.541
Please.

1378
02:03:46.333 --> 02:03:47.833
(Sa-Bok Cigarettes)

1379
02:03:52.375 --> 02:03:53.375
Here you are.

1380
02:04:04.041 --> 02:04:05.458
Hey, stop that!

1381
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:10.791
You're a good man.

1382
02:04:12.291 --> 02:04:13.375
You did a good job.

1383
02:04:20.208 --> 02:04:22.625
You… you good job too.

1384
02:04:24.791 --> 02:04:27.500
Learn Korean, before you come next time.

1385
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:31.083
Come back, speak Korean, okay?

1386
02:04:32.291 --> 02:04:33.291
Okay.

1387
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.500
Go on.

1388
02:05:40.541 --> 02:05:42.083
The curfew starts soon.

1389
02:05:42.416 --> 02:05:45.541
Did your dad run off? Cause he's so poor?

1390
02:05:47.583 --> 02:05:50.750
Sang-gu! Stop bothering your friend!

1391
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.916
But she hit me first!

1392
02:05:53.958 --> 02:05:55.708
How'd you end up that way?

1393
02:05:56.458 --> 02:05:59.083
Eun-jung, come have some fruit. Get in!

1394
02:06:33.166 --> 02:06:34.250
Daddy!

1395
02:06:37.208 --> 02:06:38.208
Eun-jung.

1396
02:06:48.041 --> 02:06:49.458
I'm sorry.

1397
02:06:50.375 --> 02:06:52.083
You waited so long…

1398
02:06:53.833 --> 02:06:56.958
Daddy, why are you crying?

1399
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.083
Daddy…

1400
02:07:05.833 --> 02:07:11.333
There's still no end in sight
to the democratic uprising

1401
02:07:11.375 --> 02:07:13.625
in the Korean city of Gwang-ju.

1402
02:07:13.666 --> 02:07:18.416
From looking at the wounded,

1403
02:07:18.458 --> 02:07:25.208
we can witness the violence done
to protesters in the last two days.

1404
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:31.166
The army has blockaded the city
and cut off all telephone and telex.

1405
02:07:32.125 --> 02:07:35.875
According to military sources,
as of Wednesday,

1406
02:07:35.916 --> 02:07:39.208
there have been 9 deaths and
about 60 people were injured.

1407
02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:42.625
However, students and protesters
mention much higher figures,

1408
02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:47.375
Are you sure you searched everywhere?

1409
02:07:47.666 --> 02:07:52.333
Yes, but there's no taxi
driver with this name.

1410
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:56.500
(Kim Sa-bok)

1411
02:07:57.583 --> 02:07:59.458
So even the number is wrong.

1412
02:08:00.541 --> 02:08:02.750
Kim Sa-bok may not be his real name.

1413
02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:07.583
It might be better not to look for him.

1414
02:08:26.166 --> 02:08:28.416
(Dec-03)

1415
02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:49.333
It is a great honor for me to
receive this award here in Korea.

1416
02:08:50.333 --> 02:08:54.416
I still remember the faces of
the citizens I met in Gwang-ju,

1417
02:08:55.125 --> 02:08:57.750
that spring of 1980.

1418
02:09:00.083 --> 02:09:02.041
And I will never forget.

1419
02:09:06.083 --> 02:09:11.083
But there is one face
in particular that I miss dearly.

1420
02:09:12.250 --> 02:09:16.333
My brave friend, Kim Sa-bok.

1421
02:09:18.375 --> 02:09:19.625
He is a taxi driver.

1422
02:09:26.125 --> 02:09:27.333
Hey.

1423
02:09:27.375 --> 02:09:28.583
Hey, young man!

1424
02:09:29.125 --> 02:09:31.416
Sorry, sir. I only have 10,000 won.

1425
02:09:31.458 --> 02:09:33.500
That's fine. Go on.

1426
02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.750
Thank you!

1427
02:09:36.791 --> 02:09:38.041
Watch your step.

1428
02:09:48.875 --> 02:09:50.708
Hey, wait!

1429
02:09:51.083 --> 02:09:54.708
Without him, news of the Gwang-ju Uprising

1430
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:55.809
would have never reached the world.

1431
02:09:55.833 --> 02:09:56.916
Oh my.

1432
02:09:58.583 --> 02:10:01.833
I'm afraid my words fail
to express my gratitude,

1433
02:10:02.291 --> 02:10:04.416
but you're always in my thoughts.

1434
02:10:04.458 --> 02:10:08.125
Mr. Kim, my dear friend.

1435
02:10:10.083 --> 02:10:11.083
Thank you.

1436
02:10:12.708 --> 02:10:14.166
I've missed you.

1437
02:10:19.333 --> 02:10:20.791
I'll keep waiting.

1438
02:10:22.541 --> 02:10:25.166
I hope to see you again soon.

1439
02:10:29.291 --> 02:10:32.791
(He said if not for Kim Sa-bok's help
he could never have made the report,

1440
02:10:32.833 --> 02:10:34.583
and he wishes to see him again.)

1441
02:10:34.625 --> 02:10:36.541
I'm more grateful to you.

1442
02:10:38.291 --> 02:10:39.833
Thank you, thank you.

1443
02:10:40.708 --> 02:10:42.833
I wanted to see you again, too.

1444
02:10:44.416 --> 02:10:46.041
At least I see you like this.

1445
02:10:46.958 --> 02:10:49.958
You've grown old too.

1446
02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.583
Hello, where to?

1447
02:11:09.625 --> 02:11:11.125
To Gwanghwamun, please.

1448
02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:13.833
Gwanghwamun, okay.

1449
02:12:16.458 --> 02:12:21.250
It would be truly wonderful
if I could meet you again.

1450
02:12:26.666 --> 02:12:31.250
Oh… really, I'd be happy beyond words.

1451
02:12:41.041 --> 02:12:47.958
If I could find you through this footage,

1452
02:12:49.208 --> 02:12:53.500
and then meet you once again,

1453
02:12:54.875 --> 02:12:57.916
I would just be so happy.

1454
02:12:58.083 --> 02:13:03.500
I'd rush over to Seoul in an instant,

1455
02:13:03.791 --> 02:13:12.875
ride with you in your taxi,
and see the new Korea.

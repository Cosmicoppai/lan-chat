00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:28.589
Hello

5
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.009
We've just moved into #203
We're the Fukushimas

6
00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:34.428
I wanted to meet the landlord

7
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.555
It's just a token gift

8
00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.265
Thank you for taking the trouble

9
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.934
It's very nice to meet you

10
00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:43.270
Um, my husband's abroad,
you see,

11
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.816
so really, it's just the two of us
I hope you'll look out for us

12
00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.442
Oh, I see
Don't hesitate to ask

13
00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:51.862
Thank you very much
Introduce yourself

14
00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:53.447
I'm Fukushima Akira

15
00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:55.616
I see, are you in Jr. High?

16
00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.326
I'm in sixth grade

17
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.203
You're so big

18
00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.164
Once you get to this age,
it's fine, but little ones,

19
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:05.292
well, other tenants tend
to complain about them

20
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.504
Oh, he's very mature
He'll be no trouble

21
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.841
Fortunately, he takes after his father,

22
00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.510
and he's a really good student

23
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.848
But now that he's in sixth grade,
he's ready to learn English...

24
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.361
Mother

25
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:38.951
Hold on

26
00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:51.839
Shh!

27
00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:56.802
In the back room, please

28
00:02:56.886 --> 00:02:57.928
The living room?

29
00:02:58.053 --> 00:02:59.096
Yes

30
00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.913
You just know
that landlord remarried

31
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.542
His first wife,
I bet you his first wife died,

32
00:03:28.626 --> 00:03:31.128
and he went and married again

33
00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.547
Just hold on, Shigeru

34
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:34.590
What is this!

35
00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.175
Just hold on

36
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.427
Here goes

37
00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.558
You OK? Was it hot?

38
00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:45.601
It's hot

39
00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:48.229
Wow, you did a great job

40
00:03:48.312 --> 00:03:49.438
It was hot

41
00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:51.899
This is your new home

42
00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:53.400
Just hold on, Shigeru

43
00:03:53.484 --> 00:03:55.027
Shall we let Shigeru out...

44
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.819
I'll let you out

45
00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:58.697
Here comes the noisy boy

46
00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:02.952
Was it hot?

47
00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:04.245
Super hot

48
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:07.998
You did a great job
We're here

49
00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:14.630
OK!
A huge success

50
00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:17.424
What floor is this?

51
00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.636
Our new home is
on the second floor

52
00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.138
Apartment 203

53
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.936
Get back inside, Shigeru

54
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:32.314
What if they see you?

55
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.485
We'll have to move all over again
Get inside

56
00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.448
Get in here!
Hey, Akira

57
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.244
Get back inside

58
00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:50.708
Shigeru, you've got to
unpack your own toys

59
00:04:52.418 --> 00:04:54.295
I'll go pick up Kyoko
at the station

60
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.841
Be careful, off you go
You know the way?

61
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:00.050
I know

62
00:05:00.843 --> 00:05:01.635
I'm off

63
00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.512
OK, off you go, then

64
00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:35.836
Did you wait?

65
00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:37.004
You're late

66
00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:38.505
I'm sorry

67
00:05:44.345 --> 00:05:45.763
Is the apartment big?

68
00:05:45.888 --> 00:05:48.766
Yeah, it's three rooms
Pretty big

69
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.268
The washing machine?

70
00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.562
On the veranda

71
00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.315
The veranda, huh?

72
00:06:02.404 --> 00:06:03.655
Kyoko!

73
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.134
We're home

74
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.102
I think I know how
to make the soup

75
00:06:33.268 --> 00:06:35.312
I know how to make the soup

76
00:06:35.437 --> 00:06:37.398
OK, then, you make it

77
00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:43.612
Such big chopsticks!
Oh, I'll eat with these

78
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:47.658
Yeah! My favorite

79
00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:49.284
Tasty?

80
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.958
May I have everyone's attention?

81
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.796
Now that we've moved
into a new home,

82
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:05.217
I'm going to explain the rules to you,
one more time

83
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.221
Let's promise to keep them, OK?

84
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:10.472
How many are there?

85
00:07:10.556 --> 00:07:15.310
OK, first of all,
no loud voices or screaming

86
00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:16.228
Can you do that?

87
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:17.521
I can

88
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:21.859
Next, no going outside

89
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:22.734
I know

90
00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:26.613
Can you do that?
Not even out on the veranda

91
00:07:26.864 --> 00:07:30.284
OK? Can you keep that promise?

92
00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:31.326
Sure!

93
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.871
Can you do it, little Shige-monster?

94
00:07:35.664 --> 00:07:39.334
You're the one that
has to promise hardest

95
00:07:39.418 --> 00:07:43.547
Absolutely no going outside
Can you do that?

96
00:07:44.339 --> 00:07:45.632
Bet you can-can

97
00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.553
He didn't raise his hand

98
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:51.847
That's right,
remember our old home,

99
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:56.560
we had to leave because
you always threw such tantrums

100
00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:00.647
So, now that we've found
a nice new home,

101
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:03.400
you've got to promise
Can you?

102
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.570
How's Kyoko supposed
to do the laundry?

103
00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:08.906
For the laundry,

104
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:11.074
there's no choice, but for Kyoko

105
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.453
to sneak out quietly for the laundry

106
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.665
Don't go out with her, Shigeru

107
00:08:19.124 --> 00:08:23.378
And Akira,
you already know all this,

108
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:28.592
but Mom's sometimes late,
so you'll be in charge

109
00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:33.472
That's OK, right?
And study a lot

110
00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.684
You really have to get it, Shigeru

111
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:39.520
Do you get it?

112
00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:43.941
If you don't...
it's an enema for you!

113
00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:47.402
Not an enema, green peppers

114
00:08:47.486 --> 00:08:48.654
Green peppers?

115
00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:49.530
Why!

116
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:51.281
Make him eat peppers

117
00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:53.408
Oh, that's it, then

118
00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:57.579
We'll give Shigeru "The Pepper
Punishment," got that?

119
00:08:57.788 --> 00:09:01.792
Next time you're up for a tantrum,
get in the suitcase

120
00:09:02.084 --> 00:09:03.710
Shut up!

121
00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:04.795
Like I...

122
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.588
That's the time to climb in

123
00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:07.881
That's right, that's right

124
00:09:07.965 --> 00:09:09.925
What a great idea

125
00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:12.427
Put him there when he's noisy, OK?

126
00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:14.721
We'll all put him in

127
00:09:24.815 --> 00:09:26.108
Mother

128
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:30.279
These tatami mats smell good

129
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:34.074
The tatami?
What do they smell like?

130
00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:36.910
Like leaves in nature

131
00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:40.872
That's a nice smell, isn't it?

132
00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:44.960
The tatami are still new,
they're still green

133
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.464
Make you sleep well?

134
00:09:49.756 --> 00:09:51.425
Good night

135
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.823
Will you be late?

136
00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:18.160
Today? Let's see...

137
00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:22.748
What's today?
Oh, I guess I might...

138
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.666
Maybe I'll be late

139
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:26.126
You want dinner?

140
00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.922
Dinner... dinner...
What's for dinner tonight?

141
00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:33.133
Maybe curry

142
00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:36.803
Curry? I want curry!
Save me some curry

143
00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.847
Please

144
00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.516
Maybe I'll eat it

145
00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:44.186
Off you go

146
00:10:55.197 --> 00:10:57.574
Hey, did Mom leave already?

147
00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.326
She just left

148
00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.912
Dangerous

149
00:12:08.395 --> 00:12:09.896
The piano...

150
00:12:19.114 --> 00:12:20.115
I'm going shopping

151
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.450
Off you go

152
00:12:22.159 --> 00:12:24.327
Get me an "Apollo Choco"

153
00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:25.454
Sure

154
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:09.539
150 yen

155
00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.550
Shall I buy persimmons...

156
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.517
No "Apollo Choco"

157
00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:36.107
There's a video arcade...
"Inageya Hardwares store"

158
00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:42.489
â€œNear and far-sighted..."

159
00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.409
Found it

160
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.704
Apollo Choco

161
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.751
No bag, right?

162
00:13:56.253 --> 00:13:58.213
Out of 100 Yen, then

163
00:14:07.389 --> 00:14:08.849
Thank you very much

164
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.354
Save 'em for later...

165
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.691
You OK?

166
00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.401
I'm fine

167
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:18.501
The bath's ready, brother

168
00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.794
You can go first

169
00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:21.171
OK

170
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:38.438
Are there carrots?

171
00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:39.648
There are carrots

172
00:15:39.773 --> 00:15:41.024
None for me

173
00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:42.943
No, you have to eat them

174
00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.121
Dinner's ready, Kyoko

175
00:15:55.205 --> 00:15:56.331
OK

176
00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:26.194
Shigeru left the carrots, again

177
00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:53.304
Elementary Japanese

178
00:17:09.195 --> 00:17:11.072
Look, Mother's home

179
00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:37.140
Hey there, I'm back

180
00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:38.933
Welcome home

181
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:44.272
It's damned cold out there
Warm in here

182
00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.191
Weren't you in bed, yet?

183
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:47.942
I was hanging the laundry

184
00:17:48.068 --> 00:17:51.613
What a good girl
Thank you

185
00:17:51.946 --> 00:17:54.866
And what do we have here?

186
00:17:56.785 --> 00:17:58.953
Can I have some?

187
00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:01.498
Damn, it's cold

188
00:18:01.623 --> 00:18:02.665
Welcome home

189
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.541
I'm home

190
00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.626
Oops

191
00:18:05.543 --> 00:18:06.669
Got it?

192
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:07.796
I can't

193
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:08.963
No way

194
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.549
It clicked but went out

195
00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:16.262
All yours

196
00:18:16.346 --> 00:18:19.474
Did I get this right?

197
00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:21.059
What's this?

198
00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:26.147
"A nation that flourished,

199
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:28.650
"in about 300 C.C."

200
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:30.819
What don't you understand?

201
00:18:30.902 --> 00:18:33.321
I just wondered if I got it right

202
00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:37.325
No, it should be "300 B.C."

203
00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:43.206
When you don't know,
you look it up in here

204
00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:45.250
That way, you'll learn

205
00:18:48.336 --> 00:18:50.630
Wow, is this Shigeru's?

206
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.842
Wow, what's this?

207
00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:59.013
This yours? Kyoko's?

208
00:18:59.681 --> 00:19:02.725
I hate math...

209
00:19:03.017 --> 00:19:07.272
Six times six is...

210
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:12.527
Six-six, six-six...

211
00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:16.823
Hurry, six-six

212
00:19:16.906 --> 00:19:18.575
I can do it

213
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:23.454
Six-six is thirty-six...

214
00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:31.754
Hello,yes

215
00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:38.052
It's noisy there, awful noisy

216
00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:41.931
Where are you? Karaoke?

217
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:48.730
Not now, it's too late

218
00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:55.111
What? Who's there?
Oh, really, what a shame...

219
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.545
And-a 2

220
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:57.465
And-a, and-a 3

221
00:20:57.799 --> 00:20:58.925
Hey, oh no

222
00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.261
And-a 1, hey

223
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.805
And-a 3

224
00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:05.598
And-a, and-a 4

225
00:21:05.974 --> 00:21:06.891
Wow!

226
00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:12.146
Oh, me? And-a, and-a 2
Wow!

227
00:21:13.314 --> 00:21:17.151
Oh, no, I'm the loser who
has to go without dinner!

228
00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.821
You won't get sleepy

229
00:21:19.946 --> 00:21:23.658
If there's no lid on,

230
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:27.829
what could be inside?

231
00:21:27.954 --> 00:21:29.872
You can't tell

232
00:21:29.998 --> 00:21:33.209
See, if you close your eyes
and put it in,

233
00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.795
if you put it in but you don't know...

234
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.981
Mother

235
00:21:56.691 --> 00:21:59.360
I want to go to school

236
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:04.365
School?
You wouldn't have any fun at school

237
00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:11.205
Besides, when you don't have a Daddy,
they bully you at school

238
00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:14.917
You don't need to go to school

239
00:22:20.048 --> 00:22:24.552
Wow, feels really great
Great smell, did you smell it?

240
00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.723
Stinks of sunlight

241
00:22:28.806 --> 00:22:29.932
Stinks of sunlight?

242
00:22:30.058 --> 00:22:34.103
Stinks of sunlight
What a beautiful day...

243
00:22:41.944 --> 00:22:43.529
Your mother,

244
00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:48.201
is in love with someone now

245
00:22:48.534 --> 00:22:49.827
Again?

246
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:56.918
Not again
This guy's really

247
00:22:57.126 --> 00:23:01.798
sweet and serious

248
00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:06.761
I think he's really
looking out for me

249
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:12.767
So, if he promises to really...

250
00:23:13.267 --> 00:23:16.604
to really marry me,

251
00:23:17.688 --> 00:23:22.443
then we can all live in a big house
and you can all go to school

252
00:23:22.568 --> 00:23:25.113
and Kyoko can play the piano...

253
00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:29.283
So just hang on a little longer

254
00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:32.161
I really think this time probably...

255
00:24:42.857 --> 00:24:45.067
I'm home

256
00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:48.779
I'm home

257
00:24:50.114 --> 00:24:52.533
Here we are, sushi

258
00:24:52.992 --> 00:24:56.329
I'm home, meow

259
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.122
Were you asleep?

260
00:24:58.206 --> 00:25:02.627
C'mon, c'mon guys,
the sushi was a present

261
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:06.005
A sushi present, c'mon, c'mon

262
00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:07.423
You wake up?

263
00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:11.969
You wake up? You mad?

264
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:15.848
C'mon over, come over,
c'mon over, Yuki

265
00:25:17.225 --> 00:25:18.768
She stinks of booze

266
00:25:18.893 --> 00:25:23.314
Aren't you cold?
Were you asleep? I'm sorry

267
00:25:23.397 --> 00:25:27.485
It's just that your Mommy had
a pretty good time today

268
00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:31.614
Here you are, Mom

269
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:33.824
Oh, thank you

270
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:57.431
Akira

271
00:25:58.349 --> 00:25:59.892
Listen, Akira...

272
00:26:00.726 --> 00:26:03.729
he's starting to look
just like his father

273
00:26:04.939 --> 00:26:08.109
He's got his father's eyes, exactly

274
00:26:11.112 --> 00:26:13.948
You brother's father...

275
00:26:14.282 --> 00:26:16.867
used to work at Haneda

276
00:26:17.577 --> 00:26:22.582
You know what Haneda is?
It's a place with lots of airplanes

277
00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:26.794
You know, right, Shigeru?
That's where he used to work

278
00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.966
Oh, I know, listen, Akira

279
00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.595
Remember going to see your father?

280
00:26:35.678 --> 00:26:36.887
I don't

281
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:41.851
We took the Monorail to
get to Haneda Airport

282
00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:44.770
You forget?

283
00:26:44.854 --> 00:26:45.896
Yeah

284
00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.276
Kyoko, your father was...

285
00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:53.237
a music producer...

286
00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:59.702
I know! Let's give Kyoko's...

287
00:27:00.828 --> 00:27:03.080
pretty hands a nice manicure

288
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:12.173
Your mother... actually...

289
00:27:12.548 --> 00:27:17.762
I wanted to be a singer

290
00:27:18.179 --> 00:27:21.932
And I really made it...
part way

291
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:24.894
With your father, Kyoko

292
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.938
Oops, way too much

293
00:27:29.815 --> 00:27:33.027
I was going to cut a record...

294
00:27:33.861 --> 00:27:36.906
And we were almost ready

295
00:27:37.031 --> 00:27:40.034
when the deal fell apart

296
00:27:40.993 --> 00:27:44.872
Your mother really wanted to, but...

297
00:28:30.918 --> 00:28:35.089
Dear Akira, Your mother's
going away for a little while

298
00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:38.592
Please look after Kyoko,
Shigeru and Yuki

299
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:00.841
I'm going shopping

300
00:30:00.925 --> 00:30:02.426
Sure, off you go, then

301
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:06.138
And also, mother won't be
coming back for a while

302
00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:07.181
Why not?

303
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:11.393
Something to do with work, I think
I'm off

304
00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:12.853
Off you go

305
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:47.471
Please enter your
deposit account...

306
00:30:58.524 --> 00:31:03.696
The rent... electricity bill,
phone and gas...

307
00:31:03.779 --> 00:31:07.408
And also...

308
00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.702
tissues...

309
00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:14.850
Let's go to my office

310
00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:26.028
Do you always do this?

311
00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:28.489
No, I don't

312
00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:30.366
Your first time?

313
00:32:31.617 --> 00:32:33.035
I didn't take anything

314
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:36.830
Then what's all this doing here?

315
00:32:42.378 --> 00:32:43.587
Your name?

316
00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:45.714
Fukushima Akira

317
00:32:45.839 --> 00:32:49.343
Fukushima... Akira...

318
00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:52.012
School?

319
00:32:55.057 --> 00:32:56.475
Your father's name?

320
00:32:56.725 --> 00:32:58.477
I don't have a father

321
00:32:58.852 --> 00:33:00.145
No father?

322
00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.566
Your mother, then?

323
00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:08.570
She's gone away to work
for a while

324
00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:10.781
Where did she go?

325
00:33:13.492 --> 00:33:15.995
If you won't tell me,
I'll have to call the police

326
00:33:16.078 --> 00:33:17.329
Sir,

327
00:33:19.164 --> 00:33:21.458
I don't think this boy stole that

328
00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:26.255
I think the boys reading comics
over there put them in his bag

329
00:33:26.547 --> 00:33:27.673
It wasn't him?

330
00:33:27.756 --> 00:33:29.883
No, I don't think so

331
00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:32.344
Why didn't you speak up?

332
00:33:32.428 --> 00:33:33.637
I'm sorry

333
00:33:36.223 --> 00:33:37.975
Don't â€œI'm sorry," me

334
00:33:48.485 --> 00:33:53.115
This is just between us, OK?
The meat buns are a little bonus

335
00:33:56.118 --> 00:33:57.536
Hurry, give it to him

336
00:34:02.374 --> 00:34:04.043
Thank you very much

337
00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:40.037
Is that a plus sign?

338
00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.288
That's right

339
00:34:49.254 --> 00:34:52.633
9,824 Yen

340
00:34:53.717 --> 00:34:56.595
9,824 Yen?

341
00:35:00.015 --> 00:35:03.018
I forgot to add this...

342
00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:50.626
Hello

343
00:37:13.148 --> 00:37:14.691
Isn't this your day off?

344
00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:18.403
I'm driving again tonight
No use staying home

345
00:37:47.557 --> 00:37:48.892
How's your Mom?

346
00:37:48.976 --> 00:37:51.687
She hasn't been home in a month

347
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:53.480
For real?

348
00:37:57.693 --> 00:37:59.069
How old are you, Akira?

349
00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:00.821
I'm 12

350
00:38:05.993 --> 00:38:07.286
And Yuki?

351
00:38:07.828 --> 00:38:09.663
Yuki's fine

352
00:38:12.165 --> 00:38:13.667
She takes after me?

353
00:38:15.836 --> 00:38:17.087
Yes, she does

354
00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:20.674
For real...

355
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:38.627
Akira!

356
00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:44.383
Shit, I'm 10 Yen short
Lend me 10 Yen

357
00:39:46.093 --> 00:39:46.885
What, 10 Yen?

358
00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:48.762
Why make a big deal over 10 Yen?

359
00:39:48.845 --> 00:39:50.931
What's with that damned big wallet?

360
00:39:51.056 --> 00:39:53.058
It's a hand-me-down
from my mother

361
00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:54.059
From who?

362
00:39:54.142 --> 00:39:55.435
From my mother...

363
00:40:02.234 --> 00:40:03.485
You moved, right?

364
00:40:04.319 --> 00:40:05.821
The new place big?

365
00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:08.115
Any pubic hair, yet?

366
00:40:08.198 --> 00:40:09.032
No...

367
00:40:09.116 --> 00:40:10.784
Liar, I got mine in 5th grade

368
00:40:10.867 --> 00:40:11.952
No way

369
00:40:12.619 --> 00:40:14.079
That's the truth

370
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:19.042
It's just...

371
00:40:19.376 --> 00:40:21.378
What are you smirking about?

372
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.800
It's just that since mother's gone,

373
00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:29.344
it's just, there's no money

374
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.431
For real? I don't have any money

375
00:40:33.974 --> 00:40:35.684
What've you got left?

376
00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:36.852
About 10,000 Yen

377
00:40:36.977 --> 00:40:38.437
10,000 Yen is enough

378
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.608
I'm in a helluva jam, myself

379
00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:47.154
My girlfriend, you know,

380
00:40:47.863 --> 00:40:52.826
she totally maxed out my credit cards
I'm in credit card hell, man

381
00:40:52.951 --> 00:40:56.496
So I'm working my ass off,
slowly paying it down, man

382
00:41:09.009 --> 00:41:11.720
This is all I've got on me
This is it, the last time

383
00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:13.263
Thank you

384
00:41:13.638 --> 00:41:16.558
All right, I'm off

385
00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:20.562
By the way, Yuki's not my kid

386
00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:24.983
Every time I did it with your mom,
I used a condom. Bye, then

387
00:41:25.066 --> 00:41:26.151
Bye, then

388
00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:28.069
Thanks for this

389
00:41:31.198 --> 00:41:32.157
Bye

390
00:41:40.415 --> 00:41:43.001
Oh, no, I'm hopeless

391
00:41:44.753 --> 00:41:47.297
Gotta get it in

392
00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:50.884
So cold...

393
00:42:04.898 --> 00:42:09.444
I spent 674 Yen
at the supermarket

394
00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:13.156
I have 650 Yen left in my wallet

395
00:42:13.615 --> 00:42:16.618
How many Yen were in my wallet
to begin with?

396
00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:29.756
Soon, I came across Bubu the Pig,
planting turnip seeds in a field

397
00:42:29.881 --> 00:42:32.592
What a nice bag you have there

398
00:42:32.676 --> 00:42:34.511
My mother made it for me

399
00:42:43.228 --> 00:42:46.606
Where, where, where is it?

400
00:42:59.578 --> 00:43:01.955
You can't go out, Shigeru

401
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.790
I'm not out

402
00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:06.209
I'm not out

403
00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.881
I'm home!

404
00:43:11.965 --> 00:43:14.050
Welcome home

405
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.262
How've you guys been?

406
00:43:17.721 --> 00:43:20.473
Hey, how've you guys been?

407
00:43:20.599 --> 00:43:23.518
See, I'm home

408
00:43:24.102 --> 00:43:27.230
Look, presents
This one's for Yuki

409
00:43:27.314 --> 00:43:28.940
Thank you

410
00:43:29.024 --> 00:43:31.234
For you, Shigeru

411
00:43:34.279 --> 00:43:35.614
I'm home

412
00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:38.825
Akira, Akira

413
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.873
Wow, it's been a while

414
00:43:45.707 --> 00:43:47.459
Shall I open it for you?

415
00:43:49.544 --> 00:43:52.839
You can carry it on your back

416
00:43:53.381 --> 00:43:54.966
Wow!

417
00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:56.009
It's cute

418
00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:58.511
Carry it? Carry it?
Like a backpack

419
00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:03.642
You can put your things inside,
and do that...

420
00:44:04.976 --> 00:44:08.521
The sides? Your ears? Out?

421
00:44:09.064 --> 00:44:10.357
Ears out?

422
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.864
You look so neat
He looks better with short hair

423
00:44:18.531 --> 00:44:20.825
Which is more becoming, Yuki?
Long or...

424
00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:21.701
Long

425
00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:26.331
You like him better with long hair?
Oh, no, but I'll cut it anyway

426
00:44:26.623 --> 00:44:28.667
A little bit shorter's OK, right?

427
00:44:31.586 --> 00:44:35.548
What's that face for?

428
00:44:36.424 --> 00:44:40.178
Don't tell me,
I cut your bangs too short

429
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:43.056
You're fine, right?
Too short?

430
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.974
I don't believe it

431
00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:50.313
Anyway, it'll grow right back out
Don't act so cool

432
00:44:50.397 --> 00:44:51.940
You look cute

433
00:44:52.607 --> 00:44:53.942
I mean it

434
00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:56.945
Here goes!

435
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:03.576
Maribo!

436
00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:07.288
A chop! The pits!

437
00:45:10.417 --> 00:45:12.585
Chop Maribo!

438
00:45:12.794 --> 00:45:14.713
Maribo!

439
00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.717
Maribo!

440
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:53.001
Hey, what are you doing?
Kyoko

441
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:59.048
What are you doing?
Don't touch my things

442
00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:04.971
It's your fault
It won't come out...

443
00:46:06.222 --> 00:46:08.558
Where were you, really, Mother?

444
00:46:09.851 --> 00:46:12.604
I told you I was working

445
00:46:13.188 --> 00:46:14.481
A whole month?

446
00:46:14.606 --> 00:46:18.777
I was in Osaka
It was just too far

447
00:46:20.361 --> 00:46:23.406
I told you not to touch my things

448
00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.868
What are you doing?

449
00:47:08.993 --> 00:47:12.956
What? You see, today,

450
00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:16.543
your mother has to step out,
so I'm getting ready

451
00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:18.086
You're going already?

452
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:22.173
Your mother's... busy today

453
00:47:23.174 --> 00:47:26.719
But listen,
I'll be back for Christmas

454
00:47:35.436 --> 00:47:37.230
Only 5,000 Yen?

455
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:43.069
He could've lent you a little more,
I mean, you're little kids in a jam

456
00:47:43.152 --> 00:47:46.030
But hey, pachinko parlors and taxis,

457
00:47:46.114 --> 00:47:49.242
don't draw customers
in such hard times

458
00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:55.164
But you go back to him
if you need to

459
00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:58.209
It's cold

460
00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.256
And the wind's blowing so hard
It's so cold...

461
00:48:06.593 --> 00:48:08.970
Did you tell the man you're seeing
about us?

462
00:48:16.394 --> 00:48:20.481
I told you, I'll tell him eventually...

463
00:48:41.294 --> 00:48:42.670
Sugar

464
00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:46.758
You've got sugar there

465
00:48:50.929 --> 00:48:53.306
God, you're irritating

466
00:48:56.059 --> 00:48:58.686
Listen, I keep asking you,

467
00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:02.148
when will you let us go to school?

468
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:06.069
What's this "school this, school that"?
Who needs to go to school, anyway?

469
00:49:06.152 --> 00:49:10.198
Plenty of famous people never
even went to school in the first place

470
00:49:10.323 --> 00:49:11.491
Like who?

471
00:49:13.409 --> 00:49:17.246
How should I know
But plenty of them...

472
00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:21.668
You're so selfish, mother

473
00:49:22.377 --> 00:49:24.295
How can you say that?

474
00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:28.675
Selfish? You want to know
who's really selfish?

475
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.303
Your father's the one who's selfish,
up and disappearing like that

476
00:49:32.845 --> 00:49:37.976
What is this?
I'm not allowed to be happy?

477
00:49:39.227 --> 00:49:40.603
What is this?

478
00:50:00.289 --> 00:50:02.500
Oh, I know someone famous

479
00:50:04.377 --> 00:50:08.673
Prime Minister Tanaka
Ever heard of him?

480
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:10.883
Never

481
00:50:11.009 --> 00:50:12.385
You're too young

482
00:50:13.469 --> 00:50:17.181
How about...
the wrestler Antonio Inoki?

483
00:50:17.557 --> 00:50:20.727
I bet he never went to school
I'm not sure, but...

484
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.228
Sure, he did

485
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:26.190
Man, you're a drag
Hurry up and finish eating

486
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.912
I'll send you money, soon

487
00:50:40.496 --> 00:50:41.831
You'll come home for Christmas?

488
00:50:41.914 --> 00:50:43.416
Sure, I'll come home

489
00:50:43.916 --> 00:50:47.503
I'll be right home
You take care, of them, too

490
00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:09.877
Is Totoro really real?

491
00:52:10.628 --> 00:52:13.172
Don't you know how big Totoro is?

492
00:52:13.297 --> 00:52:14.382
I know

493
00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:16.008
I know, he's really big

494
00:52:17.093 --> 00:52:20.388
It'd be a real mess if
he was walking around

495
00:52:20.513 --> 00:52:23.474
The police would've caught him

496
00:52:26.644 --> 00:52:28.104
Think there are UFOs?

497
00:52:28.187 --> 00:52:29.105
Nope

498
00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:29.981
Nope

499
00:52:30.064 --> 00:52:32.859
If Martians exist, so do UFOs

500
00:52:34.735 --> 00:52:36.529
Martians are...

501
00:52:36.654 --> 00:52:40.158
What about real Zombies?
Scary Zombies

502
00:52:40.825 --> 00:52:42.702
You think Santa Claus is real?

503
00:52:43.619 --> 00:52:46.706
He is, he is

504
00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:52.545
You think?
There's only one Santa, right?

505
00:52:52.712 --> 00:52:56.382
He can't cover Japan
all by himself, can he?

506
00:52:56.757 --> 00:53:00.887
But he can
Santa Claus can manage it

507
00:53:01.012 --> 00:53:02.972
That's right, there are all kinds...

508
00:54:48.452 --> 00:54:50.830
Mother didn't come back, did she?

509
00:54:52.039 --> 00:54:54.208
Her work kept her away longer

510
00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:59.338
Because I was so mean to Mom?

511
00:54:59.422 --> 00:55:01.007
No, that's not true

512
00:55:41.172 --> 00:55:44.383
Hello, this is the
Sanwa Department Store

513
00:55:45.009 --> 00:55:47.553
May I speak to Fukushima Keiko
in Menswear?

514
00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:48.971
Excuse me...

515
00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:50.306
This is her son

516
00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:52.308
Please hold a moment

517
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:06.739
I'm terribly sorry, but Ms. Fukushima
resigned last month

518
00:56:07.406 --> 00:56:08.824
How may I help you?

519
00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.140
How many minutes, Shigeru?

520
00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:34.600
Not yet

521
00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.771
Not yet... how many more minutes?

522
00:56:38.896 --> 00:56:40.272
One more minute, maybe

523
00:56:40.398 --> 00:56:41.565
Maybe?

524
00:56:41.649 --> 00:56:43.109
Maybe?

525
00:56:47.113 --> 00:56:48.614
Not ready yet?

526
00:56:57.456 --> 00:56:59.291
It's about ready, I think

527
00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:00.626
You think?

528
00:57:01.627 --> 00:57:02.878
Let's eat, then

529
00:57:04.672 --> 00:57:05.923
Thanks for the food

530
00:57:06.006 --> 00:57:07.967
Off you go, then

531
00:57:08.384 --> 00:57:09.844
Thanks for the food

532
00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:15.683
I have to lick the lid

533
00:57:28.737 --> 00:57:29.738
Tastes good?

534
00:57:30.072 --> 00:57:31.323
Tastes good

535
00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:33.284
The super-duper best

536
00:58:15.367 --> 00:58:18.496
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a phone number

537
00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:22.917
Kanagawa Prefecture,
Kawasaki City, Nakahara Ku...

538
00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:42.311
Hello, this is the Yamamotos

539
00:58:43.395 --> 00:58:47.358
Hello... Hello?

540
00:58:49.818 --> 00:58:52.655
Wonder who this is
They aren't talking...

541
00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:06.752
Good evening
Have a happy new year

542
01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:10.065
Kyoko's next

543
01:00:11.817 --> 01:00:14.278
With the "kyo" like in Tokyo

544
01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:27.791
Akira

545
01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.549
That's right...

546
01:00:36.133 --> 01:00:38.510
Mom sent us all
New Year's presents

547
01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:40.846
Look

548
01:00:41.347 --> 01:00:42.640
For you, Yuki

549
01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:43.849
Thank you

550
01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:45.017
Shigeru

551
01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:46.685
Kyoko

552
01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:50.356
That's for you

553
01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:51.774
Thanks

554
01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.526
4,000 Yen!

555
01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:59.907
4,000 Yen! No way
It's 2,000 Yen

556
01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.242
1,000 Yen

557
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.245
4,000 Yen

558
01:01:06.747 --> 01:01:08.165
4,000 Yen

559
01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.251
What do you want, Yuki?

560
01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:12.795
A doll

561
01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:14.880
Shigeru?

562
01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.256
Roller blades

563
01:01:16.382 --> 01:01:17.716
Roller blades?

564
01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.055
You, Kyoko?

565
01:01:23.138 --> 01:01:25.432
I'm saving mine up for a piano

566
01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:27.726
You, brother?

567
01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:30.312
A baseball glove

568
01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:05.013
No, I'm gonna meet
Mommy at the station

569
01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:07.599
She's not coming home today

570
01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:10.018
I'm sure she's coming home

571
01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:13.188
She'll be back next week

572
01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.816
She's really coming next week?

573
01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:17.359
She really will

574
01:02:17.693 --> 01:02:18.819
How do you know?

575
01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:20.154
I just do

576
01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.745
She's coming home next week

577
01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.294
It's Yuki's birthday, today

578
01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.160
These?

579
01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:13.248
These?

580
01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:14.333
Yeah

581
01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:31.391
Just hang on

582
01:03:38.023 --> 01:03:39.233
OK, let's go

583
01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.373
Good evening

584
01:03:54.665 --> 01:03:55.541
Good evening

585
01:03:55.624 --> 01:03:57.000
Stepping out?

586
01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:58.669
Where to?

587
01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.879
To the station to meet my Mommy

588
01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.715
I see, what's your name?

589
01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:04.883
Yuki

590
01:04:05.008 --> 01:04:07.928
Yuki, I see
How old are you, Yuki?

591
01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:08.887
I'm 5

592
01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.014
5 years old? I see

593
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.393
She's our cousin,
just staying overnight

594
01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:16.854
Oh, I see...
Off you go, then

595
01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:18.355
Off we go, then

596
01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:22.150
Adorable little girl

597
01:04:23.652 --> 01:04:28.198
Tomato, daikon, broccoli,
squash, carrot...

598
01:04:28.282 --> 01:04:29.324
There's so many

599
01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:40.335
Plates...
Cups...

600
01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.423
The butcher's...

601
01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:16.580
Oh, only one left?

602
01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:22.628
The last one

603
01:06:10.092 --> 01:06:11.510
There's the monorail

604
01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.983
It goes to Haneda Airport

605
01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:14.281
Someday, let's get on
and go see the airplanes

606
01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:19.745
Yeah, let's do that

607
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:52.671
Dear Kyoko

608
01:08:52.838 --> 01:08:57.551
To Kyoko

609
01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:18.817
No, no, it turns on
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, idiot

610
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.819
No, no, it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

611
01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.779
No, I swear it's on 5

612
01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:25.532
No, I swear it's 6

613
01:11:25.657 --> 01:11:27.617
Listen, listen, man

614
01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:31.037
You couldn't even do it on
that Kamehameha thing

615
01:11:31.329 --> 01:11:33.039
Yes I could

616
01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:36.751
Go! No, that's too far-ish

617
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.712
Oh, damn you did it

618
01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:42.632
You're a genius, man

619
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:44.676
Using the brake?

620
01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:45.760
No brake

621
01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:48.722
Hey, wow, cool

622
01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:52.058
You gotta crash it

623
01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:58.023
That one already burned...

624
01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:02.819
Welcome

625
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:09.909
Your friends?

626
01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:13.038
Yeah, friends

627
01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:17.375
That's 197 Yen

628
01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:25.342
Get off, get off

629
01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:03.755
Thanks

630
01:13:04.089 --> 01:13:05.131
Let's go

631
01:13:05.757 --> 01:13:06.716
Bye,then

632
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.512
Thank you

633
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.349
See you tomorrow
Bye, then

634
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:22.107
Please indicate the desired amount

635
01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.781
Please indicate the desired amount

636
01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.978
- Excuse us
- Excuse us

637
01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:08.319
This one, huh?
Let's do it, let's do it

638
01:14:09.154 --> 01:14:12.699
Are you ready?
Start!

639
01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.831
All right, perfect, max

640
01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.292
What!

641
01:14:25.295 --> 01:14:26.504
Take that!

642
01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:28.590
What a weird haircut

643
01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:32.135
Coke and what?

644
01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:35.346
Coke and orange and...
CC Lemon

645
01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.355
I'm home

646
01:14:44.481 --> 01:14:45.231
We bought stuff

647
01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.191
You're late

648
01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:48.318
How far'd you go?

649
01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.195
Coke for me

650
01:14:50.278 --> 01:14:51.321
Me, too

651
01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:56.284
Hey, somebody attacked

652
01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:59.454
Hey, you jerk, you let 'em in

653
01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.539
But this person attacked

654
01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:05.960
Your Gas Bill is Overdue

655
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.963
Get away, you jerk

656
01:15:13.885 --> 01:15:16.554
OK, nice

657
01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:22.685
Go away

658
01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:37.116
Told you so, dammit

659
01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:41.246
You'll never get it that way

660
01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:42.997
Butt out

661
01:15:58.221 --> 01:15:59.305
Let's go to the store, Akira

662
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.391
I'm hungry, treat us

663
01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:02.600
Sure

664
01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:04.435
Hey, I wanna go, too

665
01:16:04.519 --> 01:16:06.896
No, you stay home
Don't touch the game

666
01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:08.064
Don't touch it

667
01:16:20.285 --> 01:16:21.619
What are you doing?

668
01:16:53.735 --> 01:16:57.030
Hey, hey hey, isn't this great?

669
01:16:58.281 --> 01:17:01.868
Her tits are huge
Great, huh?

670
01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:05.663
Isn't it great?

671
01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:23.514
You swipe it?

672
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.018
Your turn, Akira

673
01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:34.067
We're friends, right? Go

674
01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.529
Let's go

675
01:17:49.624 --> 01:17:50.917
Hey, wait

676
01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.445
He's not your type?

677
01:19:42.528 --> 01:19:46.324
No way! He's way too passionate-like
I like a cool-like guy

678
01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.826
But that's what's so cool

679
01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:49.952
Been a while

680
01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:50.953
Been a while

681
01:19:51.037 --> 01:19:52.121
How you been?

682
01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:55.833
Yeah, fine

683
01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.797
They're too big for me
They don't fit

684
01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:05.384
Mom says I'll grow anyway,
so take the big ones

685
01:20:05.593 --> 01:20:07.053
I hate 'em

686
01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:08.721
Hey

687
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.519
Been a while
How you been? What's up?

688
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:19.315
I bought a new game,
why don't you come over?

689
01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.447
I'll come over
when I have time

690
01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:29.450
See you 'round

691
01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:34.205
I've got cram school, sorry

692
01:20:34.956 --> 01:20:35.915
See ya

693
01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.750
See ya, then

694
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:42.046
Who was that?

695
01:20:44.841 --> 01:20:46.425
Take me along to play

696
01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:48.719
Yeah, but his house stinks

697
01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:51.514
No way, stinks of what?

698
01:20:52.139 --> 01:20:55.601
Stinks of garbage
The place is a real mess

699
01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:56.769
Like rotting?

700
01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:01.774
Here she comes

701
01:21:55.369 --> 01:22:00.374
To Mizuguchi Saki in Heaven

702
01:22:21.479 --> 01:22:22.939
Got it

703
01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:49.048
Hello, there, Fukushima san

704
01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:45.646
Don't worry, he's gone

705
01:23:58.451 --> 01:23:59.785
How old are you?

706
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.203
I'm 12

707
01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:05.916
You can't start working part-time
until you're 16

708
01:24:08.919 --> 01:24:13.299
Shouldn't you contact the police
or child welfare, or something?

709
01:24:15.176 --> 01:24:18.429
If I do, the four of us won't
be able to stay together

710
01:24:19.722 --> 01:24:22.850
That happened before
and it was an awful mess

711
01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:25.061
I see...

712
01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:10.106
You need it for your piano
It's OK

713
01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:58.339
Let's race

714
01:27:06.597 --> 01:27:08.766
Don't beat me, Akira

715
01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.175
Welcome

716
01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:51.725
Did your mother come back?

717
01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:03.487
Who's taller?
We're the same

718
01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:57.458
There are seeds here, too

719
01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:00.210
Take them

720
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:02.212
I'll take these, too

721
01:29:02.296 --> 01:29:06.675
OK, I'll take these
Look, Akira, seeds

722
01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:11.138
Somebody just left them behind

723
01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:13.557
Poor things

724
01:29:20.314 --> 01:29:22.274
2, 3, 4, 5...

725
01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.526
Amazing, for real

726
01:29:25.069 --> 01:29:26.862
Paper, scissors, rock

727
01:29:29.573 --> 01:29:33.118
First is rock
Paper, scissors, rock

728
01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.413
I can't stop

729
01:29:54.556 --> 01:29:56.600
Akira, got dirt?

730
01:29:56.934 --> 01:29:58.018
Got it

731
01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:08.821
Shige!

732
01:30:53.323 --> 01:30:54.491
Shigeru!

733
01:30:56.326 --> 01:30:57.578
Shigeru

734
01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:00.998
Hey, Shigeru

735
01:31:01.331 --> 01:31:02.458
The bag

736
01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.065
It came out funny

737
01:31:33.697 --> 01:31:34.823
Yu...

738
01:31:40.162 --> 01:31:41.205
ki...

739
01:31:46.502 --> 01:31:48.545
I'll go get some water

740
01:32:07.898 --> 01:32:10.734
Brother, the lights don't work

741
01:32:28.544 --> 01:32:30.379
Not in the bathroom, either

742
01:33:54.087 --> 01:33:57.341
Mr. String, Mr. String,
where are you?

743
01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:30.916
What are you doing?

744
01:34:33.835 --> 01:34:35.671
Not going to school?

745
01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:36.922
No...

746
01:34:37.547 --> 01:34:39.341
I'm not either

747
01:34:50.977 --> 01:34:54.398
There's a cicada hole here,
did you know?

748
01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:56.066
No, I didn't

749
01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:02.364
And again

750
01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:07.994
Pi-ne-ap-p-l-e

751
01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:13.166
First is rock
Paper, scissors, rock

752
01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:21.425
Ch-o-co-la-t-e

753
01:35:21.550 --> 01:35:24.678
First is rock
Paper, scissors, rock

754
01:35:25.512 --> 01:35:27.264
And again!

755
01:36:20.442 --> 01:36:25.447
We have suspended
your water service

756
01:38:24.983 --> 01:38:27.444
I got so many

757
01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:28.862
Wow, amazing

758
01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:49.507
What are you doing?

759
01:38:50.467 --> 01:38:52.052
Nothing special

760
01:38:54.012 --> 01:38:55.972
Did you catch cold?

761
01:38:57.474 --> 01:38:58.975
Your voice sounds weird

762
01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:00.810
Shut up

763
01:39:21.915 --> 01:39:23.667
Are you washing your hair?

764
01:39:25.085 --> 01:39:26.753
Yesterday, at the park

765
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.736
Nice and cool?

766
01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:06.584
When's your mother coming back?

767
01:40:07.377 --> 01:40:08.962
She's never coming back

768
01:40:13.341 --> 01:40:14.426
Probably

769
01:41:27.165 --> 01:41:30.335
I'm not hot
I'm hot

770
01:41:34.214 --> 01:41:36.549
I said, I'm not hot, I'm not

771
01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.637
Thank you

772
01:42:09.958 --> 01:42:11.835
Eat the inari sushi first

773
01:42:19.843 --> 01:42:21.010
Shigeru

774
01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:26.933
No salmon?

775
01:42:27.016 --> 01:42:29.352
No, just what's there

776
01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:31.187
No fair

777
01:42:50.456 --> 01:42:53.501
This was Shigeru's
It died

778
01:43:13.855 --> 01:43:15.273
She fell asleep

779
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:33.374
Excuse me, the door was unlocked...

780
01:43:36.211 --> 01:43:39.422
I'm the landlord from the 3rd floor,
here about the rent

781
01:43:40.423 --> 01:43:42.050
Where's your mother?

782
01:43:42.967 --> 01:43:46.137
She's working in Osaka

783
01:43:49.224 --> 01:43:51.476
Are you cousins?

784
01:44:29.264 --> 01:44:30.890
I'll go make some money

785
01:44:30.974 --> 01:44:32.850
What? How?

786
01:45:38.624 --> 01:45:39.292
Here!

787
01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:40.293
No

788
01:45:40.793 --> 01:45:43.713
Why not?
I just sang karaoke with him

789
01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:45.089
No!

790
01:47:21.602 --> 01:47:23.104
What are you eating?

791
01:47:24.439 --> 01:47:25.648
Spit it out

792
01:47:30.278 --> 01:47:31.696
What is that?

793
01:47:34.574 --> 01:47:35.950
Paper

794
01:47:48.004 --> 01:47:50.214
That's 287 Yen

795
01:47:56.471 --> 01:47:58.306
Exactly, thank you

796
01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:02.685
How'd the semester go?

797
01:48:02.768 --> 01:48:06.856
His report card, you mean?
A total disaster

798
01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:10.860
He got a terrible grade in Japanese

799
01:48:10.985 --> 01:48:13.237
My child did badly, too

800
01:48:34.926 --> 01:48:36.802
Wish I could find something

801
01:49:05.122 --> 01:49:06.582
Hey, where's Shigeru?

802
01:49:07.542 --> 01:49:08.918
Dunno

803
01:49:18.553 --> 01:49:20.263
What are you doing?

804
01:49:21.055 --> 01:49:22.390
Where's Shigeru?

805
01:49:22.473 --> 01:49:23.724
Dunno

806
01:49:58.175 --> 01:49:59.260
Shige!

807
01:50:01.596 --> 01:50:04.432
You said you wanted noodles
so I got some!

808
01:50:04.515 --> 01:50:05.683
What do you want!

809
01:50:06.267 --> 01:50:07.893
You watch it, buster

810
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:10.688
Don't bother coming home

811
01:50:10.813 --> 01:50:12.690
Don't take it out on things

812
01:50:21.449 --> 01:50:22.658
Did it break?

813
01:50:25.119 --> 01:50:26.495
Amazing power

814
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:28.706
He's just an idiot

815
01:52:49.764 --> 01:52:51.474
Cut it out, Yuki

816
01:52:52.433 --> 01:52:54.518
I have to pee

817
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:58.063
Why didn't you pee
in the park, before?

818
01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:00.983
Go pee by the bath

819
01:53:01.942 --> 01:53:03.110
Don't want to

820
01:53:11.118 --> 01:53:13.496
Is Saki coming back?

821
01:53:32.723 --> 01:53:36.101
Shigeru! You can't just
use up all the water!

822
01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:39.104
There's none left to drink

823
01:53:46.028 --> 01:53:48.113
Is Saki coming to play again?

824
01:53:48.197 --> 01:53:49.281
Never

825
01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:13.097
What are you doing?

826
01:54:14.515 --> 01:54:16.058
I'm selling these

827
01:54:18.644 --> 01:54:19.979
Don't need 'em anymore

828
01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:22.231
Stop it

829
01:54:22.356 --> 01:54:23.315
Cut it out

830
01:54:23.399 --> 01:54:24.775
Let go!

831
01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.901
Shut up!

832
01:54:26.277 --> 01:54:27.653
Move

833
01:54:28.863 --> 01:54:30.406
Don't touch it!

834
01:54:36.662 --> 01:54:38.414
She's never coming back

835
01:54:42.668 --> 01:54:46.338
Who cares! Stay in there!
Idiot!

836
01:55:29.173 --> 01:55:33.469
Miyauchi!
Don't move your legs too much!

837
01:55:43.771 --> 01:55:47.483
Kato! Where's Yano today?

838
01:55:47.608 --> 01:55:48.859
Cram school

839
01:55:48.984 --> 01:55:53.113
Cram school?
Oh, man, we're short

840
01:56:07.711 --> 01:56:09.630
What year are you?

841
01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:17.680
Akira, #9, right field

842
01:56:24.019 --> 01:56:25.312
Line up!

843
01:56:33.696 --> 01:56:38.450
We're starting a game between the
White Bears and the Kenzan Fighters

844
01:56:38.701 --> 01:56:40.202
Let's

845
01:56:40.494 --> 01:56:41.412
Bow

846
01:56:41.537 --> 01:56:43.080
Let's

847
01:57:26.457 --> 01:57:31.211
Akira, hold your hands closer,
like this...

848
01:57:31.587 --> 01:57:35.924
When the ball comes,
take a real hard slice at it, wham

849
01:57:36.050 --> 01:57:38.010
Just, Wham, swing at it

850
01:57:46.727 --> 01:57:48.896
That's fine, nice swing...

851
01:57:48.979 --> 01:57:54.276
"A big, big,
homerun, homerun"

852
01:57:54.401 --> 01:57:57.446
"In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma..."

853
01:59:04.096 --> 01:59:05.305
Yuki

854
01:59:06.348 --> 01:59:07.724
Yuki won't get up

855
01:59:10.102 --> 01:59:11.311
Yuki!

856
01:59:14.314 --> 01:59:16.066
She fell off the chair

857
01:59:26.034 --> 01:59:27.202
Yes, hello?

858
01:59:27.327 --> 01:59:29.246
Is Fukushima Keiko there?

859
01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:31.915
Just a minute,
I'll go get her

860
02:00:44.321 --> 02:00:47.824
Mommy

861
02:01:42.170 --> 02:01:46.633
A big, big...

862
02:01:47.634 --> 02:01:49.928
homerun...

863
02:01:50.846 --> 02:01:55.767
In heaven...
Grandpa and grandma

864
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:58.603
So surprised...

865
02:02:00.522 --> 02:02:05.402
A big... homerun...
In heaven...

866
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.529
Akira

867
02:02:38.769 --> 02:02:40.062
What happened?

868
02:02:49.529 --> 02:02:52.240
That money...
Can I borrow it?

869
02:02:55.035 --> 02:02:58.246
I want to show Yuki...
the airplanes

870
02:03:10.759 --> 02:03:15.305
You all off for a picnic?
Looks like fun

871
02:03:16.348 --> 02:03:18.975
That'll be 1,895 Yen

872
02:03:22.312 --> 02:03:23.980
OK, thanks

873
02:03:55.387 --> 02:03:57.222
Kyoko, what's this?

874
02:03:58.140 --> 02:03:59.808
It just arrived

875
02:04:14.072 --> 02:04:19.244
To Akira, give them my best
I'm counting on you, Mother

876
02:04:49.691 --> 02:04:50.859
She doesn't fit

877
02:04:53.695 --> 02:04:56.865
Guess Yuki... grew

878
02:06:12.274 --> 02:06:13.984
Is it good bye?

879
02:10:54.347 --> 02:10:56.891
When I touched Yuki
this morning...

880
02:10:59.143 --> 02:11:01.813
she was so cold, it was awful

881
02:11:08.361 --> 02:11:10.321
It just felt so...

882
02:11:13.783 --> 02:11:16.244
It was just so...

883
02:12:42.622 --> 02:12:48.169
When I ask the midnight sky

884
02:12:50.588 --> 02:12:56.260
the stars just shine

885
02:12:58.346 --> 02:13:04.352
Into the black lake of my
molten heart

886
02:13:06.145 --> 02:13:11.526
I can only flow

887
02:13:13.987 --> 02:13:19.617
Will the angel even give me
a backward glance?

888
02:13:21.536 --> 02:13:27.166
Want to splash around in my heart?

889
02:13:29.168 --> 02:13:34.674
The winds of the coming winter
lap at the waves

890
02:13:36.884 --> 02:13:42.515
calling me into the dark

891
02:13:44.225 --> 02:13:51.566
With eyes as wilted as ice

892
02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:58.865
I'm growing up

893
02:13:59.115 --> 02:14:06.205
A jewel pungent with a stench

894
02:14:06.581 --> 02:14:14.380
that brooks no one's approach

895
02:15:10.103 --> 02:15:11.229
Thanks

896
02:16:32.977 --> 02:16:34.187
